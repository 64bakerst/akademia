- ### Silver Salt Sage
  collapsed:: true
	- A Cup and a half of crystalised salt (non Iodinised), Sage and Silver in locations around the body during sleep can have very beneficial effects. Perseverance is the key. These are all separate products you can easily aquire no matter where you are. Place all ingredients in a zip locked plastic bag. You can then put it into another bag which doesn't have to be plastic. It can be some material you are comfortable with also. Mix it up also for yourself if you feel the urge. Crystals etc. Experimentation is advised as perhaps your gutt is looking for you to act in alignment with your personal truth. So attempt to be disciplined and maintain it over time as HEALING IS A PROCESS NOT AN EVENT....So invest in yourself.
	- The main locations to employ are at base of skull where it meets the neck. The other main area to employ is the tailbone. Other areas can be relative to areas of physical discomfort. You can also have them attached all day to. Or sitting at your computer at the base of the tailbone / spine can offer protection also. Explore this yourself.

	- Rebalance your body to push out memories into the awake body so that the dream body can srote more memories
	  The heart determines where these memories are being stored
	  Certain areas (shoulder, lower back, legs, calves) where cellular memories are stored - where the body downloads exccess negative energy the brain doesn't want to process so it can have a clear operating system - it's like clearing out your temp files and cookies
	  The combination of silver, sage, and salt allows the junk files to get dumped into the salt. - Put into tailbone and neck
	  Do really hot foot baths
	  Add cedar and sage into the water - feet are a flushing mechanisms too
	  Put salt pack on your back and bring that energy out of your crown chakra, downt eh charkras and into the tailbone - concentrate on the tailbone, add swirling energy to tailbone - it's going to create a swirling pattern into your root chakra, as a flushing mechanisms out of each leg. 
	  If reliving a memory - Say "I'm releasing that cellular memory, I am clearing that out of my body - It goes out of my crown, into my sacral, into my root and out through my feet" Expel and delete memroes that no longer serve you
	  Massaging yourself is one of the greatest way to find out where you're dumping your junk - simple massage, steaming, excersice, swimming,
	  Right hand on kidney, left hand on leg and vise versa to balance the energies between the organs and legs - the thighs store tremendous amounts of toxins until you're ready to let it go, and when you're letting it go you understand you're letting go of cellular memory at the same time
	  If you ignore the areas where you're having pain or discomfort you're just inviting parasites. Some don't have sentience, other do - they become habit patterns in our lives.
	  Our dreaming body literally lives inside our organs
	  Stomach to lower and upper interstines
	  Between root and sarcal charka and just a little above
	   it doesn't exist in your head
	  When entering into sleep - Energy of the mind, third eye and the crown go in the heart - heart takes all the energy and goes into the solar plexus - then into the dream body - goes into paralasys, need to go.
	  All of the upper energies are in the sacral chakras building up this wave pattern before they go into the root. At that time is when you have the actual physical mental moment to say I want to lucid dream. That is how you battle the autopilot programming
	  The root chakra will blast with red energy, blossoming red petals into one another creating a prism of energy. 
	  That's when the programmer comes in and says "the pain in my back, feet need to be healed, the relationship with this person needs to be healed" 
	  the root chakra goes up through the body has a stem, opens up like a flower, you enter dream time, dream worlds. This is where you look to your cellular memory , into dream time maps, dream time compass, that allows you to see the dream time lighthouses that are out there so you may project your dreamtime body to those spots and experience those spots with all of your mind
	  This is a mechanical process
	  A lot of times cellular memries will give the wrong way to enter the dreaming body
	  Our dreaming bodies do not have enough energy to leave the body but they can dream things into the dreaming body. Not enough energy to create the actual stem of the flower to open up the flower.
	  But it has it's radio, it can tune into people that are in the soul family or spirits that are related to the soul family to be teachers, where a lot of people experience the school effect, where it feels like you'ore in a school being educated or having these talking dreams - lots of conversations over and over again, bringing in the broadcast energy of 7,333,000,000 people out there, each in sperate dream times and you're looking for your vibratory soul familes the dream time societies that teach you how to grow that stem into a flower to go out og the body to those places to help empower you to find the power or lights to bring it back into the flower back into the sacral chakra, and back up, recharging your energy body.
	  At that point the words that the programmer said to the dream time, you get a second change to repgram your self again so you don't have the seperation of two worlds. You can have two or three or four hours of perfect recall of everything within that vision.
	- How we can properly work within ourselves clear ourselves, and all else will come naturally
	- We have for lived
	  What kind of blends do you have, for kidney, for intestines?
