## Use of Healing

- Drink hydrogen peroxide solution on an empty stomach
	- 1 hour before or
	- 3 hours after a meal
- Add food grade hydrogen peroxide to 8 oz. distilled water, spring water, milk, vegetable juice, or fruit juice.
- *There is an enzyme in fresh pressed carrot juice and bananas that breaks down H202 into water and oxygen on contact. No sugary, alcoholic or carbonated beverages.* 
- ***Do not use chlorinated tap water.*** 
- Hydrogen peroxide is used to pasteurize milk in most countries around the world. 12 drops of 35% food grade hydrogen peroxide in a quart of milk is an alternative to pasteurization. 
- If your stomach gets upset at any level, stay at that level, or go back one level. 
- Try not to burp after drinking the hydrogen peroxide solution; it is probably singlet oxygen (O1).
- When reaching higher dosages, more water may be used. Deep breathing, fresh air, and exercise are also very important. If you are on a medication, consult your doctor. 
- Candida victims may need to stay at the Day 1 dosage level for up to 1 week before beginning the hydrogen peroxide regimen.

##### Caution
- Taking hydrogen peroxide immediately before bedtime causes difficulty getting to sleep because of the increased oxygen levels at the cellular level. 
- CAUTION: Individuals who have had transplants should not take hydrogen peroxide. 
- Hydrogen peroxide stimulates the immune system and could cause the rejection of the transplanted organ. 
- Keep hydrogen peroxide out of the reach of children. Store hydrogen peroxide in the back of the refrigerator or in the freezer in a box or in a marked container
- CAUTION: If any strong solution of hydrogen peroxide concentrate is spilled on the skin, flush the skin immediately with water. Skin may whiten temporarily. 


## Using Food Grade Hydrogen Peroxide

 Bathing: Use about 64 oz. (2 quarts) of the of 3% or 3.5% diluted hydrogen peroxide solution in a tub full of warm water. Do not try this before bedtime, because the absorbed oxygen energizes the body and prevents sleep. Soak in the bath for at least 1/2 hour. Add hot water to maintain bath temperature keeping pores and blood vessels dilated, facilitating absorption of oxygen through your skin. 
 
 Colonic: Add 1 cup (8 oz.) 3% H2O2 to 5 gallons warm water. (Do not exceed this amount) 
 
 Douche: Add up to 6 tablespoons of 3% H2O2 to a quart of warm distilled or filtered water. 
 
 Dishwasher: Also add 2 oz. of 3% hydrogen peroxide to your wash cycle. 
 
 Enema: Add 1 tablespoon of 3% H2O2 to a quart of warm distilled water. 
 
 Facial: Use 3% on a cotton ball as a facial freshener after washing. Keep away from eyes and eyebrows. 
 
 Foot Soak: Soak feet in warm 3% H2O2 until condition is improved. 
 
 Insecticide Spray: Mix 8 oz. black strap molasses or white sugar, and 8 oz. 3% hydrogen peroxide in 1 gallon of water. 
 
 Fruits and Vegetables: Add 1/4 cup 3% H2O2 to a full sink of cold water. Soak fruits and vegetables 20 to 30 minutes (drain, dry and refrigerate) or spray fruits and vegetables with a solution of 3% hydrogen peroxide. Let stand for a few minutes, then rinse and dry. (e to Coli cleaner)
 
Kitchen: Keep a spray bottle of 3% hydrogen peroxide in the kitchen. Use it to clean and disinfect counter tops and appliances. 

Marinade: Place meat, fish or poultry in a casserole (avoid using aluminum pans). Cover with a dilute solution of equal parts of water and 3% H2O2. Place loosely covered in refrigerator for 1/2 hour. Rinse and cook.

Mouthwash: Use 3% H2O2. Add a dash of liquid chlorophyll or peppermint / spearmint oil for flavoring if desired. Use to treat gingivitis and chronic bad breath. After brushing teeth and tongue, swish H2O2 in mouth for a couple of minutes and then gargle with it, then spit out and rinse. If pain occurs, spit out and try on the following days, etc. Do not attempt with sores in mouth. May also reverse tooth sensitivity. Convert 35% food grade H2O2 to get 3% hydrogen peroxide by adding 1 tablespoon of 35% H2O2 to 11 tablespoons of distilled non-chlorinated water (1:11 ratio). 

Nasal Spray: Mix 1 Tablespoon of 3.5% hydrogen peroxide with 8 oz. (1 Cup) of distilled water. Use 2-3 squirts of nasal spray when you start experiencing congestion..

Pets: For small animals (dogs & cats) use 1 oz. 3% H2O2 to 1 quart of water. 

Plants (house and garden): Put 1 oz. 3% hydrogen peroxide in 1 quart of water. Water or mist plants with this solution. 

Seed Sprouting: Add 1 oz. 3% hydrogen peroxide to 1 pint of water and soak the seeds overnight. Add the same amount of hydrogen peroxide each time you rinse the seeds. #growing #germination 

Shower: Keep a spray bottle of 3% hydrogen peroxide in the shower. Spray your body after washing. Avoid the eyes, eyebrows and hair

Toothpaste: Use baking soda and add enough 3% H2O2 to make a paste or dip your brush in 3% H2O2 and brush. Hydrogen peroxide dissolves dental plaque, creates healthy gums, whitens teeth and helps eliminate chronic bad breath. Baking soda and hydrogen peroxide makes the best toothpaste. 

Washing/Laundry: Add 8 oz. of 3% H2O2 to your wash in place of bleaches. 

Vaporizer (Cool Mist): Add 12 oz. of 3% food grade hydrogen peroxide or up to 4 oz. of 35% food grade hydrogen peroxide to one gallon of water or mix 16 oz. (2 Cups) of 3.5% hydrogen peroxide with 128 oz. (1 gallon) of water in a vaporizer. Emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, bronchitis, pneumonia, etc., usually gets better using a cool mist vaporizer filled with a hydrogen peroxide mixture.

### Drinking Hydrogen Peroxide

The human body expels 70 percent of its toxins from breathing. When you breathe, fat molecules combine with oxygen atoms, producing carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is the most abundant product of metabolism. The other 30 percent of toxins are discharged through defecation and sweat. A small amount of water soluble toxins are discharged through urination. If your breathing is not operating at peak efficiency, you are not ridding yourself of toxins properly. Research shows that shallow breathers get cancer more often. Drinking Hydrogen Peroxide usually helps rid the body of excess toxins, bacteria, viruses and cancers. The acidic properties of fat lower the body's cellular pH and oxygen levels, producing an ideal breeding ground for cancer. Cancer needs an acidic low oxygen environment to survive and thrive. Your kidneys must work overtime if less than 70 percent of your toxins are not being released through breathing, causing a number of illnesses.

A 1:1000 solution of [[colloidal silver]] to H2O2 increases the efficacy of colloidal silver by up to 100 times against bacteria. The increased bioavailability reaction using colloidal silver and H2O2 results in a delivery mechanism that increases adsorption of silver directly into tissues. Dilute the H2O2 to the desired concentration, and then add the colloidal silver to the solution. The amount of hydrogen peroxide to use will depend on the type and quality of colloidal silver. The higher the particle content, the more hydrogen peroxide will need to be used. A 3% H2O2 solution with colloidal silver is much more reactive than standard 3% H2O2 solution.

Drinking hydrogen peroxide may cause an upset stomach. 

**Hydrogen peroxide should be taken on an empty stomach, one hour before meals or three hours after meals.** 

Food in the stomach may cause excess foaming, indigestion or vomiting. 

Those with chronic systemic Candidiasis may need to start with **1 drop in 8oz. of water 3 times a day, then 2 drops in 8oz. of water three times a day before starting a schedule**. 

**Do not mix chlorinated tap water with 35% Food Grade Hydrogen Peroxide!** 

People with serious problems will benefit from **staying on 25 drops three times a day for one to three weeks, then tapering down to 25 drops two times daily until the problem is resolved (1 to 6 months)**. Some patients take three or four lecithin capsules at the same time they take the hydrogen peroxide to stop the nausea.


As dead bacteria and toxins are released from your body, your capacity to eliminate them quickly enough may cause some pain or discomfort in the kidneys. This toxic overload may cause fatigue, diarrhea, headaches, skin eruptions, cold or flu-like symptoms, and/or nausea. If this occurs, remain at the current dosage or reduce it to the previous dosage until the problem stops. Do not discontinue drinking the hydrogen peroxide solution unless pain or irritations become severe. Discomfort and irritations will dissipate shortly after cutting back on the amount of hydrogen peroxide you are drinking. **Continuing with the hydrogen peroxide program will clean out the body sooner of excess toxins.** 

Another method of drinking hydrogen peroxide, requires putting **1 drop of hydrogen peroxide in every ounce of water you drink**. If the taste of the hydrogen peroxide is to strong for you, try putting 1 drop of hydrogen peroxide in every 2 ounces of water you drink.



### Healing

Microdoses of hydrogen peroxide applied to the wound site, from amounts greater than 500 nanomoles to less than 50 micromoles per square centimeter of lesion, signal leukocytes to help the body’s own healing processes at the edges of the wound. The body’s naturally occurring supply of hydrogen peroxide runs out at the wound site about two hours after an injury occurs. Laboratory experiments have shown that the body’s leukocytes begin the healing process at the wound site, by using minute quantities of hydrogen peroxide produced internally in the body. 

When microdoses of hydrogen peroxide are applied to a wound: 
• The body’s natural healing processes are enhanced. 
• Leukocytes are drawn to the wound margins. 
• The rate of healing in mammals is increased.

Microdoses of hydrogen peroxide used in different formulations (gels, lotions, ointments, creams, pastes, liquids, etc.) and applied in various ways (surgical dressings, staples, clips, sutures, catheters, implants, etc.) can speed the body’s own healing process at the wound site and opens the way to new wound care protocols, dressings and devices that naturally help wounds heal faster. Surgical dressings with microdoses of hydrogen peroxide can start, continue, enhance, and support the body’s own healing process by continually adding hydrogen peroxide to the wound after the body’s supply runs out

Normal human cells have a lot of molecular oxygen and a slightly alkaline pH. The cancer cell has an acid pH and lack of oxygen. Cancer cells will not survive in an oxygen environment. Cancer and all diseases do not like oxygen. Proper cellular utilization of oxygen requires diets containing adequate amounts of unsaturated fatty acids. Most common ailments affecting population are directly related to oxygen starvation.

Some results from drinking hydrogen peroxide include: arthritis disappearing, high blood pressure was normalizing, cancers going into remission, high energy levels returning, bowels regulated, alertness and increased memory, elimination of depression, etc. Hydrogen peroxide stimulates enzyme systems throughout the body, increasing metabolic rate, causing small arteries to dilate and increase blood flow, enhancing the body's distribution and consumption of oxygen while raising body temperature.


### Gardening 

Gardeners and hydroponics implementers have professed the use of Hydrogen Peroxide in their watering solutions. Spontaneous decomposition releases oxygen to the plant's roots to enhance root development and prevent root rot, due to lack of oxygen. Many farmers have been increasing crop yields by spraying diluted hydrogen peroxide (20 gallons of water mixed with 5 to 16 ounces of 35% hydrogen peroxide, per acre). Water house plants by adding 1 ounce of 3% hydrogen peroxide or 16 drops of 35% hydrogen peroxide to every quart of water you give your plants. Hydrogen peroxide is an excellent and safe insecticide. Spray your plants with 8 ounces of 3% hydrogen peroxide mixed with 8 ounces of white sugar and one gallon of water.
