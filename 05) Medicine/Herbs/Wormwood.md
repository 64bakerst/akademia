#Wormwood 

-   Absinthe is a botanical spirit made from wormwood, anise and fennel, but that’s not all wormwood is good for. It’s used to eliminate intestinal worms, especially roundworms and pinworms, and it’s the source of of the key ingredient for the herbal drug artemisinin, which is the most powerful antimalarial on the market.
-   It’s also been shown to kill cancer cells and treat anorexia, insomnia, anemia, a lack of appetite, flatulence, stomach aches, jaundice and indigestion.


The active chemicals in wormwood include absinthin, anabsinthin (both [bitter](https://www.healthyhildegard.com/what-foods-are-bitter/) compounds), and a volatile oil that is 70% thujone.

Thujone is an active organic chemical that acts as an antagonist of the neurotransmitter GABA. GABA controls neuron excitability in your brain. When thujone limits GABA activity, your receptors in your nervous system become more active.

As a result, high doses of wormwood can cause excitability or nervousness and muscle spasms. In fact, toxic doses of thujone from wormwood in Absinthe is part of how Absinthe got its reputation for hallucinations and other effects. [Source](https://www.healthyhildegard.com/wormwood-benefits/)


Wormwood’s other active chemical compounds include:

-   acetylenes (chemicals that are naturally anti-parasitic)
-   tannins
-   ascorbic acid (vitamin C)
-   azulenes (aromatic compounds containing dark blue pigments)
-   carotenoids (nutritional organic compounds)
-   flavonoids like quercitin (bitter nutrient compound)
-   lignins
-   phenolic acids (aromatic acids)



## Benefits

Folklore prescribes wormwood for general deficiencies in digestive juices and malaise. There is some [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17240130) that indicates that wormwood benefits include easing the symptoms of crohn’s disease as well as _small intestine bacterial overgrowth_ or SIBO.

In addition, you can also use a wormwood tincture externally for wound cleansing and treating insect bites. Other wormwood benefits include:

-   Anti-inflammatory
-   Anti-pyretic (fever reducer)
-   Chemotherapeutic (kills cancer cells)
-   Anti-microbial & Anti-fungal (kills bacteria, viruses, and funguses)
-   Anti-parasitic (kills parasites)

## Precautions

Wormwood is generally regarded as safe for you when used appropriately for short durations. You should not take in large amounts or long-term. Other wormwood precautions to consider:

-   Do not take more than  3 grams or 60 tincture drops of wormwood per day.
-   Your daily regimen should not exceed a period of 2 weeks.
-   Do not consume wormwood during pregnancy.
-   Wormwood is unsafe for pregnant women because it has uterine and menstrual stimulating effects.
-   If you have a seizure disorder, consult your doctor before using wormwood.
-   If you are taking medications, particularly anti-convulsants (for seizures), wormwood may interfere with these medications.
-   To be safe, you should not use wormwood while breastfeeding.
-   If you are known to have [ragweed allergies](https://www.healthyhildegard.com/pollen-allergy/) (or other asteraceae plants) you may have allergic reactions to wormwood.
-   Wormwood is not recommended for people with kidney disorders.

## Recipes

### How to Make a Wormwood Room Spray

Wormwood is naturally antimicrobial and anti-fungal, so you can use wormwood as a spring-cleaning preparation to ward off potential illness. 

Combine one (1) teaspoon of dried (or 2 teaspoons fresh) wormwood along with chopped thyme, rosemary, and lavender together with 2-3 cloves. Add 1/2 liter of apple cider vinegar. Allow the mixture to sit for 3 to 4 weeks in a cool dark place.

Strain the juice into a mist or spray bottle. Lightly mist your living areas each morning to help create a clean air environment and strengthen the immune system.

##### Effects
- has sesquiterpene lactones, which weakens the parasite’s membrane making them confused and weak ^waslur
- Beats Malaria - Artemisinin is an extract isolated from Wormwood - the most powerful antimalarial on the market.  it reacts with the high levels of iron in the parasite to produce free radicals. The free radicals then destroy the cell walls of the malaria parasite. [~](https://draxe.com/nutrition/wormwood/)
- Fights Cancer Cells - artemisinin can battle iron-enriched breast cancer cells similar to the way it eliminates malaria-causing parasites. Cancer cells can also be rich in iron since they commonly soak it up to facilitate cell division. The normal cells showed little change, but within 16 hours, almost all of the cancer cells were dead and only a few normal cells were killed.
- Treats Crohn’s Disease - Researchers [found](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17240130) that there was a steady improvement in Crohn’s disease symptoms in 18 patients (90 percent) who received wormwood in spite of the decrease of steroids. After eight weeks of treatment with wormwood, there was almost complete remission of symptoms in 13 (65 percent) patients in this group as compared to none in the placebo group. This remission lasted until the end of the observation period, which was 20 weeks (12 weeks later), and the addition of steroids was not necessary.
- Contains Antimicrobial and Antifungal Abilities - Not only can wormwood kill bacteria, but it’s also been shown to kill fungi. Research [shows](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15740015) that essential oil distilled from the aerial parts of _Artemisia absinthium_ inhibited the growth of a very broad spectrum of tested fungi (11 to be exact). The wormwood essential oil also showed antioxidant properties during testing. Another study published in _Planta Medica_ [concludes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12624823) that _A. absinthium_ oil inhibits the growth of _Candida albicans_. This is the the most common type of yeast infection found in the mouth, intestinal tract and vagina, and it may affect skin and other mucous membranes.
