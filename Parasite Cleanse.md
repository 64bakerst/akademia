### Smoothie
- full tablespoon of fresh papaya seeds - 1/4 of a cup of papaya seeds
-  third of a small or around a fifth of a large papaya
	- Ideally you’d be looking for a fruit that is just turning from green to yellow, with green more predominant. Papaya like these should still contain useful levels of digestive enzymes
- quarter of a cup of raw organic pumpkin seeds
	- [Pumpkin seeds paralyze worms](https://superfoodprofiles.com/pumpkin-seeds-parasites-intestinal-worms "Pumpkin Seeds and Parasites – Getting Rid of Human Intestinal Worms with Pumpkin Seeds") in the lower intestine and add to the effectiveness of the papaya seed actions.
- heaped tablespoon Desiccated coconut
- fresh coconut then using the coconut water
- full tablespoon of organic virgin coconut oil
	- The lauric acid in coconuts is converted to the compound monolaurin in the digestive tract, which can help rid the body of protozoa, ringworm and giardia parasites
- half a dozen fresh cloves
	- help break down the protective coating that cover intestinal worm eggs
	- Clove oil capsules taken at the same time as the smoothie may also work but I think fresh cloves are better. It can also be good to pre-soak them in a small amount of your smoothie liquid, along with the papaya seeds, before you blend.
- healthy ‘milk’ of your choice to half as high as the rest of the ingredients
	- Ideally use coconut water or half coconut milk and half water. Coconut is good for parasites and using it for your smoothie’s milk as well increases its effectiveness.
- Drink the whole smoothie down in one sitting if you can. first thing in the morning on an empty stomach before food. intended to be a breakfast replacement.
- initial treatment - three or even four mornings in a row
- repeat the treatment in two weeks time and again in another two weeks
	- this is to coincide with the breeding cycles of common parasites, such as tapeworms, hookworms and pinworms.
	- By repeating the treatment three times over a 6 week period there’s a much better chance of interrupting this breeding cycle, or up to 3 months to be completely sure that you have dealt with intestinal worms and other kinds of parasites at their various life cycles.
- #### Laxative
	- Ayurvedic triphala powder, [like this organic one I take](https://amzn.to/37Zgdx7), is one of the few truly beneficial laxatives for occasional use.
	- You can make it up at the same time as the smoothie and let it sit for a couple of hours to increase its effectiveness.
	- Follow the directions for the stronger dose in the page on [taking triphala for digestive health](https://superfoodprofiles.com/how-to-take-triphala-churna "How to Take Triphala Churna for Digestive Health") and drink it around two hours after you finish the smoothie and before eating anything else.
	- no laxatives should be taken for more than five days in a row. Triphala is fine at the lower doses for longer term use.
