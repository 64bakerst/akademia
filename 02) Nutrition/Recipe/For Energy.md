- ## Brain Power
	- ### Bulletproof Coffee
		- **Ingredients**
			- 1 cup strong, high-quality coffee
				**- Replaceable with**
				- 2–3 tea bags organic green tea
				- 1 tsp organic matcha green tea powder (more or less depending on preferred strength)
				- 2 cups hot strong-brewed organic black tea
				- 2–4 tbsp loose leaf yerba mate
			- 1–2 tbsp MCT Oil (preferably Brain Octane)
			- 1–2 tbsp unsalted, grass-fed butter
			- Stevia, Honey, Maple Syrup for sweetener
		- **Optional Ingredients** (not all at once, just ideas)
			- 1-2 tbsp Great Lakes Gelatin/Collagen
			- ½ tsp cinnamon
			  ¼ tsp sea salt
			- ½ cup filtered water
			  ½ cup coconut milk
			- ¼ tsp vanilla extract
			  2 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder
			- ¼ tsp ground cinnamon (to taste)
			  ¼ tsp ground ginger (to taste)
			  1 tsp honey or a few drops of Stevia
			- Stevia, cinnamon, ginger, and/or curcuma to taste
		- Why
			- MCT Oil
				- MCTs are a particular kind of fat requiring less energy and fewer enzymes to break down for digestion, compared to other fats and sugar.
				- What this means is that you get the nutrients into your system in far fewer steps than you would from even a piece of toast. MCT oil is also good for your gut (2) , it has anti-microbial properties, and it curbs hunger and cravings.
				- MCT can assist in mild weight loss and maintaining a healthy weight. Best of all, MCTs convert to energy on a cellular level without having to process through your liver, which keeps your liver healthy and clean!

		- How
			- BLEND
			- Remember, oil and water do not blend naturally, so adding butter and oil to your coffee will make it look like an oil liner spilled in the Pacific. The only way to get the elements to blend into your coffee properly is to use a blender. A spoon stir is never going to work.
