### Some know issues
This an early version of MindStone, which mean there are bugs and issues. Below are some known issues, that I plan to work on:
- Image link in wiki link style is not supported yet. `![[Image_link.png]]` will not work yet.  see work around below
- Graphview does not load when clicking on side-bar or click node on graphview, browser reload will refresh it state
- Graph view layout and interaction is still very rough. More UI/UX improvements are needed.
- Transclusion is not working yet.
