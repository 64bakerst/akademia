# [[4 - Disinfection]] - To remove parasites, bacteria, & viruses

### To Make Drinkable

###### Make sure to filter large pieces through a basic filter that can be thrown away or disinfected after every use. 

###### Charcoal & sand is a good basic filter before Disinfection, but make sure to filter once again after disinfection.

### Boiling
- Most effective - best method
- Boiling point of water - 212 F (100 C)
- 160 F (70 C) kill all pathogens within 30 minutes 
- above 185 F (85 C) within a few minutes
- To be extra safe, let boil for an additional minute

### Chemical Purification
- Most effective against bacteria & viruses
- Does not kill parasites
- ***Wait 30 minutes after using any of these methods for complete disinfection***
	- [[Iodine]]
		- 5 drops = .25ml per 1 litre
		- 20 drops - 1ml per 1 gallon
		- Add vitamin C - 50 milligrams per litre/200mg per gallon to eliminate any taste or color of iodine.
	- [[Hydrogen Peroxide]]
		- 10 drops = .5ml per 1 litre
		- 40 drops = 2ml per 1 gallon
		- ***DO NOT EXCEED MORE THAN 1 DROP per OUNCE***
	- Chlorine/Bleach
		- 5.25% sodium hypochlorite
		- 2 drops = .1ml per 1 litre

### Light Purification
- Effective against parasites, bacteria, & viruses
- Recommended AFTER Filtration
- Does not remove heavy metals or chemicals
	- [[UV-C]] - Water must be clear, let any particles settle before treating
		- Good for: [[Survival]], [[Basics]], 
		- Recommended Brands: Larq, 
		- Pro: Fast & Effective
		- Con: Requires Electricity
	- [[4 - Disinfection#Solar Disinfection|Solar Disinfection]]
		- Good for: [[Homesteading]]
		- Pro: Most natural & basic
		- Con: Requires clear containers, Takes time (more than 6 hours), requires sunshine

# [[5 - Filtration]] - To remove Parasites, Bacteria, & Heavy Metals

### Large Particle Filtration - If Cloudy - do BEFORE first Disinfection


### Small Particle Filtration - do AFTER disinfection to prevent contamination of filter

- Filter - 1micron or smaller with a cyst rating of NSF53 or 58 certification
- Carbon/Charcoal
	- Berkey
- Chemicals
- Flouride
	- Berkey

### Final disinfection - UV-C to ensure all pathogens are killed
- UV-C
	- Larq
