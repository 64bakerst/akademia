			- Water disinfect: pine, juniper, fir, cedar.
			  15-20 grams of young broken twigs, per 1 liter of water (add to the boiling water and allow to cool and stand), at the bottom there is a sediment, similar to small flakes - it is dirt, do not use it.
			- Oak, beech, willow, willow and birch have a huge supply of tannins that destroy microbes, various fungi and most viruses.
			- To disinfect, do the same thing, 15-20 grams of the bark of these shrubs per 1 liter, boil for about 30 minutes, or you can just insist in warm water for 6-8 hours.

# Basics

## Boiling

Boiling is the most certain way of killing all microorganisms. According to the Wilderness Medical Society, water temperatures above 160 F (70 C) kill all pathogens within 30 minutes and above 185 F (85 C) within a few minutes. So in the time it takes for the water to reach the boiling point (212 F or 100 C) from 160 F (70 C), all pathogens will be killed, even at high altitude. To be extra safe, let the water boil rapidly for one minute, especially at higher altitudes since water boils at a lower temperature (see page 68.)

High temperatures kill most germs quickly. Boiling is always a reliable single-step method for killing all common intestinal germs found in water without imparting additional taste or color; however, boiling does not improve taste, smell, or appearance of the water. Urban travelers may choose an immersion coil for boiling water (a plug adapter and current converter might be necessary). Any water brought to a boil is considered adequately disinfected but continued boiling for 1 minute (from the time the water begins to bubble) allows for a margin of safety. Although the boiling point decreases at higher altitudes, at common travel elevations, the water temperature remains adequate to kill intestinal germs. Boiling does not prevent recontamination during storage.

## Chemical Purification
### General Chemical Treatment Procedures

-   The effectiveness of all chemical treatment of water is related to the temperature, pH level, and clarity of the water. Cloudy water often requires higher concentrations of chemical to disinfect.
-   If the water is cloudy or filled with large particles, strain it, using a cloth, _before_ treatment. Large particles, if swallowed, may be purified only "on the outside."
-   Add the chemical to the water and swish it around to aid in dissolving. Splash some of the water with the chemical onto the lid and the threads of the water bottle so that all water areas are treated.
-   The water should sit for _at least_ 30 minutes after adding the chemical to allow purification to occur. If using tablets, let the water sit for 30 minutes _after_ the tablet has dissolved.
-   The colder the water, the less effective the chemical is as a purifying agent. Research has shown that at 50 F (10 C), only 90 percent of _Giardia_ cysts were inactivated after 30 minutes of exposure. If the water temperature is below 40 F (4 C), double the treatment time before drinking. It is best if water is at least 60 F (16 C) before treating. You can place the water in the sun to warm it before treating.
-   Chemically treated water can be made to taste better by pouring it back and forth between containers, after it has been adequately treated. Other methods include adding a pinch of salt per quart or adding flavorings (e.g., lemonade mix, etc.) after the chemical treatment period.

### [[Iodine]]
- Iodine is effective against disease-causing pathogens, is affordable, and is extremely portable. Since it’s simple to use, it makes a great emergency water purifier but we still recommend using a combination of filtration and purification just to make the cleanest drinking water available.
-  works best if the water is over 68 F (21 C).
- has been shown to be more effect than chlorine-based treatments in inactivating _Giardia_ cysts

##### DOSAGE
| **Preparation** | **Iodine** | **Amount/Liter** |
| --------------- | ---------- | ---------------- |
|Iodine Topical Solution|2%|8 drops|
|Iodine Tincture|2%|8 drops|
|Lugol's Solution|5%|4 drops|
|Povidone-Iodine (Betadine®)|10%|4 drops|
|Tetraglycine hydroperiodide  (Globaline® ,  Potable Aqua®, EDWGT®)|8 mg|1 tablet|

- 5 drops (0.25 mL) of iodine to 1 litre of water. 
- 20 drops (1mL) per 1 gallon (4 litres)
- Mix the iodine and water together. 
- Let stand for at least 30 minutes before drinking.
-  **Do not use iodine to purify water for certain people**:
    -   people who are allergic to iodine - possibly including people allergic to shellfish
    -   people who have a thyroid disorder
    -   people who are taking lithium (a medication)
    -   women over fifty and women who are pregnant (without a doctor's advice)

##### Removing Iodine from Water
Although you can add iodine into water as a disinfectant, water contains iodine naturally. Seawater has been known to hold large quantities of iodine while river water contains much smaller amounts. The best-known method for removing iodine from water is using activated carbon. This process includes the following steps:
1.  Prepare iodine solution in a container of your choice.
2.  Add a small quantity of activated carbon in the iodine solution and shake it.
3.  Leave the solution for a few minutes.
4.  Filter the solution into a container using a filter paper to remove the activated carbon.
The mixture of iodine and activated carbon will accumulate as residue on the filter paper, and the water that passes through will be iodine free.

##### Dealing with the Taste

While iodine disinfected water isn’t the most pleasant tasting water in the world, there are things you can do to help. Removing the iodine from the water, as mentioned in the section above, is one method. Here are some additional ways that will drastically improve the taste.
- **Fix the Taste** Adding vitamin C (about 50 milligrams per litre/200mg per gallon) to iodized water completely eliminates any taste or color of iodine. You must wait until the iodine has purified the water before adding the vitamin C. The vitamin C in drink mixes like Tang™ has the same effect.
- **Aerate the Water:** Just aerating the water can make a huge difference when it comes to smell and taste of the iodine. You can easily aerate the water either by shaking the bottle it’s in vigorously for a short time, or by pouring it back and fourth between two containers.
- **Add in a Powdered Sports Drink Mix:** Another way is to use powdered sports drink mixes to hide the taste. This is a very common method used by serious outdoors men who utilize iodine as a means for producing drinking water in the back country.
- **Use Neutralizing Tablets:** Many commercially available iodine tablets which are made for purifying drinking water come with neutralizing tablets included. These are truly amazing! After you are done treating the water with iodine, add in one small neutralizing tablet, shake, and it will completely neutralize the iodine. It will taste and smell exactly like fresh, pure water.

Adding a powdered sports drink mix can also add electrolytes to the drink, making it much more beneficial for a body that has endured a day of strenuous activity. These drink mixes are also incredibly shelf stable and can last for years sealed in their original packaging.


### [[Hydrogen Peroxide]]
- DOSAGE
	- 10 drops (.5 mL) per 1 litre
	- 40 drops (2mL) of 3% hydrogen peroxide to 1 gallon

### Bleach/Chlorine
	- 2 drops of bleach to 1 litre of water
	- Mix the water very well and let it stand for 30 minutes. 
	- If there is a slight chlorine smell and the water looks clear, it’s safe to drink.

## Light Purification

### Ultraviolet Light

UV light can kill all waterborne bacteria, viruses, and parasites, but the water must be clear and free of particles to allow the UV light to reach all the organisms. Battery-operated, portable units that deliver UV doses are available and may be useful for disinfecting small quantities of clear water. Whether an adequate UV dose is being delivered is difficult to determine so extra doses can be used for added assurance with no adverse effects. UV light treatment does not improve taste, smell, or appearance of the water or prevent recontamination during storage.

### Solar Disinfection

Solar disinfection (SODIS) may be used in austere emergency situations to disinfect relatively clear water. 
- Place clean, clear plastic PET or glass bottles (up to 3 L (3 qt) volume) filled with water 
- on a dark surface in the sun 
- for at least 6 hours (2 days if cloudy) 
- and agitate periodically.
- If unable to read large text through the bottle of water (looking at the bottom of the bottle through the neck at the top), flocculation or filtration should be performed before SODIS is used. 
- Treated water should be kept in and either drunk directly from the bottle or poured into a cup immediately before drinking to prevent recontamination.
