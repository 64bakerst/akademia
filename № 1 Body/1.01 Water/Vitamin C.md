# Max Daily Dose
-  oral doses of 1.25 g/day ascorbic acid produce mean peak plasma vitamin C concentrations of 135 micromol/L [source](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-HealthProfessional/)
-  safe upper limit for vitamin C is 2,000 milligrams a day [source](https://www.webmd.com/diet/features/the-benefits-of-vitamin-c)
- The body doesn't store vitamin C, so overdose is not a concern. But it's still important not to exceed the safe upper limit of 2,000 milligrams a day to avoid stomach upset and diarrhea
- Because your body doesn’t store them, you need to keep them in your diet all the time to maintain healthy levels. Eat vitamin-C-rich fruits and vegetables raw, or cook them with minimal water so you don't lose some of the water-soluble vitamin in the cooking water.



- required for the biosynthesis of collagen, L-carnitine, and certain neurotransmitters
- involved in protein metabolism
- an important physiological antioxidant
- regenerate other antioxidants within the body, including alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E)
- plays an important role in immune function
- improves the absorption of nonheme iron [5](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-HealthProfessional/#en5), the form of iron present in plant-based foods
- enhance the absorption of iron when the two are eaten together.


- High levels of vitamin C (millimolar concentrations) are maintained in cells and tissues, and are highest in leukocytes (white blood cells), eyes, adrenal glands, pituitary gland, and brain. Relatively low levels of vitamin C (micromolar concentrations) are found in extracellular fluids, such as plasma, red blood cells, and saliva
