## Using Pure Ingredients - Simple Daily Schedule

###### **USE ONLY ONE METHOD PER INGREDIENT**
- **Capsules** are most convenient
- **Drops** are effective
- **Powders** are good if you can get access to fresh herbs, or if you want to buy in bulk. 
	- Powders are also good if you want to fill up your own capsules - Size 0
	- If you want to take powders raw - they MUST be mixed with honey - make a tincture with the powders. Wormwood is bitter and Cloves are strong - the Black Walnut Hull will neutralize the tastes - add the proper dosages to 4 ounces of water. Add honey to taste and water as needed (the more watery, the more bitter)

The dosages below are the generally safe daily doses. If you want intensive schedules, then only use the protocols as outlined further.

## Smoothie - Super Effective, Super Potent

[Source](https://superfoodprofiles.com/papaya-seeds-parasites)
#### Ingredients
- fresh **papaya seeds** - 1 Tablespoon to 1/4 Cup
- **papaya** - 1/3 of small or 1/5 of large - 1 Cup 
	- Ideally you’d be looking for a fruit that is just turning from green to yellow, with green more predominant. Papaya like these should still contain useful levels of digestive enzymes
- **raw organic pumpkin seeds** - 1/4 Cup
- **Sunflower Seeds** (optional - 1/2 Cup)
- **organic virgin coconut oil** - 1 Tablespoon
	- The lauric acid in coconuts is converted to the compound monolaurin in the digestive tract, which can help rid the body of protozoa, ringworm and giardia parasites
- **Desiccated coconut** - 1 Heaping Tablespoon
	- If have a fresh coconut, use the **coconut water** instead of plain water
-  **fresh cloves** - 6 cloves
	- Clove oil capsules taken at the same time as the smoothie may also work but I think fresh cloves are better. It can also be good to pre-soak them in a small amount of your smoothie liquid, along with the papaya seeds, before you blend.
- **Tumeric Powder** - 1 Teaspoon
- **Ice** - 1/2 Cups
- **Yogurt** (optional) - 3 Heaping Tablespoons
	- eases the taste + strength of cloves
- **healthy ‘milk’** of your choice - half as high as the rest of the ingredients - 1.5-2.5 Cups
	- Ideally use **coconut water** or **half coconut milk and half water**. Coconut is good for parasites and using it for your smoothie’s milk as well increases its effectiveness.

#### Directions
- Drink the whole smoothie down in one sitting if you can, first thing in the morning on an empty stomach before food. 
- Intended to be a breakfast replacement.

- Drink 3 or 4 mornings in a row
- Repeat the treatment every 2 weeks
	- this is to coincide with the breeding cycles of common parasites, such as tapeworms, hookworms and pinworms.
	- By repeating the treatment three times over a 6 week period there’s a much better chance of interrupting this breeding cycle, or up to 3 months to be completely sure that you have dealt with intestinal worms and other kinds of parasites at their various life cycles.

- Must use a Laxative

- #### Laxative
	- Ayurvedic triphala powder, [like this organic one I take](https://amzn.to/37Zgdx7), is one of the few truly beneficial laxatives for occasional use.
	- You can make it up at the same time as the smoothie and let it sit for a couple of hours to increase its effectiveness.
	- Follow the directions for the stronger dose in the page on [taking triphala for digestive health](https://superfoodprofiles.com/how-to-take-triphala-churna "How to Take Triphala Churna for Digestive Health") and drink it around two hours after you finish the smoothie and before eating anything else.
	- no laxatives should be taken for more than five days in a row. Triphala is fine at the lower doses for longer term use.

# General Foods


## Seeds

#### [[Pumpkin Seeds]] - 1 cup daily
- Contains compound cucurbitins - paralyze worms, prevent them from holding on to the intestinal walls so they can be easily be removed during a bowel movement.
-  one of the richest natural sources of magnesium
	- a magnesium-deficient diet is associated with higher intestinal inflammation. This diet also led to a decline in the quantity of _bifidobacteria_, a crucial species of the human microbiome that is responsible for everything from producing B vitamins to protecting the gut from harmful pathogens.
- [Pumpkin seeds paralyze worms](https://superfoodprofiles.com/pumpkin-seeds-parasites-intestinal-worms "Pumpkin Seeds and Parasites – Getting Rid of Human Intestinal Worms with Pumpkin Seeds") in the lower intestine and add to the effectiveness of the papaya seed actions.


#### [[Sunflower Seeds]]
- flush out parasites by [preventing successful germination or penetration](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11604462) of the parasite to the host system.
- naturally rich in vitamin E, and research finds that vitamin E can help improve immune resistance to nematode infection in livestock. ([16](https://web.uri.edu/sheepngoat/vitamine/), [17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5622016/))

## Bulb
#### Onions
- Onions contain various sulfur metabolites that help inhibit compounds inside parasites necessary for its survival. ([11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6023319/))
 ### Garlic 
- For best results, chop up garlic and let it sit for several minutes so it can release its beneficial, microbe-fighting compounds.
- richness of sulfur compounds such as alliin, allicin, diallyl sulfide, and ajoene which are antibiotic (destroys pathogenic organisms), antilipidemic (reduces the amount of fat in the bloodstream), antithrombotic (decreases the formation of blood clots), and anti-carcinogenic (helps arrest the development of cancer)
- Germanium is found in very small quantities (5-10 parts per million) in the earth’s crust, but it is concentrated in plants – especially those known for building immunity! For example, garlic contains 754 ppm of germanium, ginseng contains 250-320 ppm, comfrey contains 152 ppm, and aloe vera 77 ppm. Germanium plays a key role in the circulation of oxygen to the body’s tissues, and stimulates our natural killer (NK) cells which help fight and prevent cancer. [source](https://www.regenerativenutrition.com/content.asp?id=442)

## Vegetables

- #Cucumber
	- Is 90% or more water and water is essential in flushing down the parasites, including the eggs of worms in the body. It is also composed of Vitamins A, B, C, D, and E, which are hated by parasites and bacteria. Tapeworms, specifically hate cucumbers.

## Roots
- #Ginger
- #Tumeric
	-  promotes circulation, rekindles the digestive fire, purifies the blood, clears congestion and nourishes the tissues including the brain
	- completely inhibit the growth of Candida albicans, as well as a number of other fungal strains, stops Candida from adhering to human cells, performing with greater efficacy than the commercial antifungal drug fluconazole. [source](https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/63/2/337/711570)
	- #anti-depressant -  high degree of safety in dosages up to 12g daily "curcumin may be used as an effective and safe modality for treatment in patients with MDD without concurrent suicidal ideation or other psychotic disorders.” [source](Efficacy and Safety of Curcumin in Major Depressive Disorder)
- #Beet 
- #Carrot
- 

## Fruits

#### [[Pineapple]]
- try 2 juiced pineapples
- Contains bromalin, boosts the intestinal track, reacts with the protein of the parasite body - it breaks down the peptide’s bonds of parasites, causes cuticle damage in worms, leading to loss of motility and death. Incorporating pineapples into your diet helps to slowly erode the protective layer of these bugs so that they are easier for your immune system to fight and eliminate.
-  bromelain-rich fresh pineapple juice is able to decrease production of the proinflammatory cytokines that lead to colon inflammation
- Because bromelain is a protein-digesting enzyme (proteolytic), it is also an extremely valuable digestive aid that helps us break down protein foods. When the protein you eat is not properly broken down into amino acids (which would be the case in those with low HCL or insufficient digestive enzymes), you’re missing out on key building blocks that act as precursors for neurotransmitters.

#### [[Papaya]]
- adds significant fiber to your body to sweep away many parasites that cling to the walls of the intestines.
- contains papain, digestive enzymes, which condition the tummy making it hostile to bacteria and parasite.

#### [[Papaya Seeds]]
- the seeds of papaya contains more papain than the flesh
- highly rich in anti-helminthic and anti-amoebic properties that effectively protect your body from many parasites.
- more effective when consumed in conjunction with honey.
- #Coconut
- #Coconut_Oil 
	- Virgin coconut oil [has Lauric and fatty acids](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/coconut-oil/#:~:text=Fat%20is%20made%20up%20of,to%20raise%20harmful%20LDL%20levels.) which are dubbed as a very good anti-viral, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and anti-parasitic. 
	- medium-chain-fatty acids are able to  destroy candida (harmful yeast)  and kill the intestinal parasite Giardia, which is responsible for causing diarrhea. ([15](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15991042))
	- Virgin coconut oil when ingested raw will cleanse your throat, digestive tract, and colon. This will also serve as a lubricant to your body giving the worms some difficulties in attaching to the linings of the intestines.
- Berries
	- #Blueberry, #Strawberry, and #Blackberry
	- researchers believe that berries could get rid of the parasites due to the help of another compound in berries - ellagitannin.
- #Pomegranite

## Other

### Kefir
### Sauerkraut
### [[Apple Cider Vinegar]]
- contains B-vitamins


## Herbs

### [[Wormwood]]

**-   Do not take more than  3 grams or 60 tincture drops of wormwood per day.**
![[Wormwood#^waslur]]
##### Recipe
###### Tea
- Steep 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of dried or fresh wormwood in one cup/250ml of boiling water for five to 15 minutes.
- It’s important that you use no more than one teaspoon of the leaves as they’re very strong and bitter. Longer steep time will make for a stronger wormwood tea, but also a more bitter tea.
- Wormwood tea should be taken unsweetened to have the best effect, but you can counter the bitterness by adding dried peppermint, anise, honey, or lemon juice.


### [[Clove]]
- helps break down the protective coating that cover intestinal worm eggs


### [[Thyme]]

## Avoid
-   Added sugar – Can feeds harmful organisms in the gut and contribute to inflammation.
-   Processed foods – Do not support immune health and may be hard to break down.
