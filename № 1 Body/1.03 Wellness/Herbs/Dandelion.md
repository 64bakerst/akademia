# Intro

##### HIGHLIGHTS



##### DOSAGE

- The _German Commission E Monographs_ recommends 3 to 4 g of the root or 10 to 15 drops of root tincture twice a day, or 4 to 10 g of the leaves or 2 to 5 mL of leaf tincture 3 times a day.
	- The _British Herbal Pharmacopoeia_ recommends 3-times-daily administration of 0.5 to 2 g of dandelion root or 4 to 8 mL of root tincture, whereas the _German Commission E Monographs_ recommends 3 to 4 g of dandelion root or 10 to 15 drops of root tincture twice a day, or 4 to 10 g of dandelion leaves or 2 to 5 mL of leaf tincture 3 times a day.[5](https://www.drugs.com/npp/dandelion.html#fandc-np5109.b5), [40](https://www.drugs.com/npp/dandelion.html#fandc-np5109.b40)

- Dandelion root has been used in daily doses of 9 to 12 g when prepared as a tea for treating digestive problems. The dried root decoction is made by boiling dandelion root for five to 10 minutes. It is taken in doses of 1/2 to 2 tsp. three times a day. The root tincture is made as a 1 to 2 ratio of root added to 45 percent alcohol and taken in doses of 100 to 150 drops three times a day.
- Because median lethal dose values in mice are 37 g/kg for the root and 29 g/kg for herb, the acute toxicity of dandelion is considered low.[17](https://www.drugs.com/npp/dandelion.html#fandc-np5109.b17) A study in rats demonstrated decreased male fertility, including decreased sperm count, motility, normal morphology, and pregnancy rate, with administration of an aqueous extract of dandelion.[44](https://www.drugs.com/npp/dandelion.html#fandc-np5109.b44)

##### Overview

Contrary to popular assumption, [dandelions](https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-control-dandelions-2132927) are more than just a weed that takes over your front lawn. Native to Europe and Asia, dandelions have been used medicinally for thousands of years, and they’ve been a staple in certain cuisines for almost as long. The greens of the plant are high in calcium, iron, and potassium, and very low in calories, making them delicious in salads. The [flowers](https://www.thespruce.com/edible-flowers-1403398) have many uses as well, including for wine, fresh in salads, and deep-fried in butter, and the young buds are high in protein. Unopened flower buds are tender and tasty, and they offer a crunch in green salads.

This wonderful plant is one of the most common weeds on Earth. The ubiquitous dandelion's ingenious seed-spreading adaptation is one of its most well known features. Is Mother Nature suggesting a need for this plant almost everywhere man dwells? Who among us has not blown the downy top of a dandelion and watched the tiny seedpods carried away in the wind? There are many different common names for the _Taraxacum_ genus throughout the world originating from how the plant looks to what type of action it produces in the body. The French "dent-de-leon" meaning, "tooth of the lion" seems to be the derivation of our North American common name, Dandelion. The leaves do indeed resemble sharp teeth. Dandelion greens and roots have both been consumed by many different cultures as a food source and are both nutritionally dense and healthy choices.

Dandelion is a rich source of vitamins A, B complex, and C, as well as minerals such as iron, potassium, and zinc. Dandelion leaves are used to add flavor to salads, sandwiches, and teas. The roots are used in some coffee substitutes, and the flowers are used to make wines. Traditionally, dandelion roots and leaves were used to support the liver. Native Americans also boiled dandelion in water and took it to support healthy excretion from the urinary tract, skin health, and upset stomach. In Traditional Chinese Medicine as well as European herbal Medicine Dandelion was and still is used to support the liver and gall bladder, to promote digestion and to support the detoxification process. The leaves have more of a noticeable effect for supporting healthy fluid elimination.

## Chemistry

Dandelion leaves are one of nature's richest green vegetable sources of beta-carotene, from which vitamin A is created (14,000 units per 100 g of dandelion leaf versus 11,000 units per 100 g of carrot). They are also a very good source of fiber, potassium (297 mg, or 7.6 mEq per 100 mg of dandelion leaf), iron, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, thiamine, and riboflavin. Sodium and vitamins C and D are also present. The flowers also contain carotenoids.

Dandelion root contains triterpenes, including beta-amyrin, taraxol, and taraxerol; sterols, including beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, taraxasterol, homotaraxasterol; sugars; choline; inulin; pectin; glucosides; phenolic acids; gum; resins; minerals; and vitamins. Identified acids include caffeic, p-hydroxyphenylacetic, chlorogenic, oleic, and palmitic acids, and the fatty acids linoleic and linolenic; gallic and ascorbic acids are also found. The bitter taste is attributed to the presence of sesquiterpene lactones.[2](https://www.drugs.com/npp/dandelion.html#fandc-np5109.b2), [3](https://www.drugs.com/npp/dandelion.html#fandc-np5109.b3), [5](https://www.drugs.com/npp/dandelion.html#fandc-np5109.b5), [6](https://www.drugs.com/npp/dandelion.html#fandc-np5109.b6)

# Growing

Every part of the plant can be used and they’re easy to grow. Best planted in early spring through late summer, dandelions will grow quickly, with seeds germinating in around 10 days.

### Light

Dandelion plants prefer a spot in full sunlight, but can happily grow in just about any light conditions. That being said, they will grow more rapidly under at least eight to 10 hours of sunlight daily.

### Soil

If there's one thing dandelions aren't particular about, it's their [soil mixture](https://www.thespruce.com/how-do-i-find-out-my-soil-type-2130788). Whether your garden boasts soil that is sandy, loamy, rich, or clay-like, dandelions will find a way to thrive. However, if you're hoping to grow plants that are nutritious and hearty, you'll want a mixture that is rich in nitrogen.

### Water

Dandelion plants like consistent moisture and should be watered regularly in order to keep the soil moist but not sopping. If you're unsure whether your plants need water, stick your finger 2 to 3 inches deep into the soil—if it's dry, it's time to water your plant.

### Temperature and Humidity

Dandelions can tolerate soil temperatures down to 50 degrees Fahrenheit but thrive best in a climate that's around 70 degrees Fahrenheit or more. This explains why they often don't start cropping up in your lawn as "[weeds](https://www.thespruce.com/common-lawn-weeds-2132462)" until mid-summer or so.

Additionally, dandelions require no special humidity and can thrive in both humid and moderately dry environments.

### Fertilizer

Dandelions can benefit from a bit of organic matter mixed into the soil, but otherwise do not need any specific fertilizer, though it will not be detrimental to their growth if they happen to receive some from nearby applications to other plants. That being said, if you plan to eat and cook with your dandelion plants, you need to make sure to only apply an [organic fertilizer](https://www.thespruce.com/fish-emulsion-as-organic-fertilizer-2539760) to any nearby crops to prevent any chemical contamination.

## How to Grow Dandelions From Seed

Dandelions can be sown outdoors four to six weeks before the last spring frost. Sow seed directly into the ground—once they’ve sprouted above the soil, thin them so they're 6 to 8 inches apart. Dandelions readily [reseed](https://www.thespruce.com/best-self-sowing-annual-flowers-4145063) themselves, but often in places where you’d rather they didn’t grow. Be sure to clear them from your garden before they bolt to seed if you'd like to avoid this issue.

## How to Harvest Dandelions

A few weeks before harvesting your dandelion's leaves, cover the plants with dark, opaque fabric to block out most of the light—this will blanch the leaves, reducing the plant's bitterness. The youngest leaves are the least bitter and most flavorful, and tender leaves can be picked throughout the growing season.

If you are harvesting the blossoms from your dandelions, pick the flowers when they are still bright yellow and young. Use them fresh, making sure to remove all of the stems. To prevent the flowers from closing after cutting, place them in a bowl of cold water, taking them out just before eating or serving them.

The roots of the dandelion can be harvested at any time. To prepare them, you can chop the dried roots into pieces 2 inches long and roast at 300 degrees Fahrenheit for about 10 minutes, then grind the roasted pieces, adding a quarter teaspoon to your coffee or hot chocolate for a new flavor.
