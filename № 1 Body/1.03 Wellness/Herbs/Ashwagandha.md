# Benefits 

In [Ayurvedic medicine](https://draxe.com/health/ayurvedic-medicine/), ashwagandha has been used for more than 2,500 years for its thyroid-modulating, neuroprotective, anti-anxiety, antidepressant and anti-inflammatory properties. Some of the many uses for ashwagandha include:

-   Helping decrease inflammation and protect against oxidative damage
-   Acting as a [natural stress reliever](https://draxe.com/health/stress-relievers/), such as by helping maintain homeostasis even in moments of emotional or physical stress
-   Lowering [cortisol levels](https://draxe.com/health/cortisol-levels/) (considered one of the body’s main stress hormones)
-   Balancing thyroid hormones
-   Strengthening the immune system after illness
-   Enhancing stamina and physical performance and building muscle strength
-   Treating [adrenal fatigue](https://draxe.com/health/3-steps-to-heal-adrenal-fatigue/)
-   Improving sleep quality
-   Reducing anxiety and depression
-   Reducing brain cell degeneration
-   Normalizing blood sugar and helping to protect against diabetes
-   Lowering cholesterol and triglycerides
-   Potentially helping prevent heart disease, stroke and cancer
-   Boosting fertility, including by [improving sperm count in males](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19501822)
-   Managing symptoms of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)

Many of the herb’s medicinal properties — including its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects — are due to the presence of protective compounds called withanolides, a group of steroidal lactones, such as withaferin A, withanolide D and withanone. Additionally, ashwagandha has been found to contain many other health-promoting substances, including flavonoids, catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione, alkaloids, amino acids, sterols, tannins and lignans.

# Precautions

Research shows that ashwagandha is NOT necessarily safe for and should be avoided by:

-   Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding
-   People using diabetes medications, blood pressure medications, medications that suppress the immune system, sedatives or medications for thyroid problems
-   Anyone being treated for hyperthyroidism, unless under the supervision of a doctor
-   Anyone with autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, unless working with a doctor
-   People undergoing surgery that requires anesthesia

It’s also recommended that ashwagandha not be mixed with alcohol, mood-altering drugs or sedatives, since it can increase drowsiness and causes mood alterations.
