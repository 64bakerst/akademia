Every Native American, European, and Early American settler used this plant medicinally for the same purpose; the health of the urinary tract.

It does contain the chemical arbutin. It is known that the body excretes 64-75% of arbutin in urine, and arbutin converted to hydroquinone maintains a healthy microbial balance within the urinary system. It is best to limit the use of Uva Ursi to short term, with two weeks being a maximum length of time. Uva Ursi also contains allantoin, a chemical also found in Aloe, which has a soothing effect.

> Most evidence for uva ursi comes from studies done in a lab rather than on humans. If you have a UTI, it may or may not clear it up. If you want to try it, look for a whole plant extract that provides 400–840 mg of arbutin in a daily dose.


One research review examined 14 over-the-counter products to evaluate each one’s ability to block urease, an enzyme that promotes infection from _Staphylococcus saprophyticus,_ a common type of bacteria in the urinary tract.3 

Only one of the 14 preparations in the study was able to significantly lower urease (by more than 75%). That preparation was uva ursi combined with green tea. 

Another study found that “the antibacterial and astringent benefits [in uva ursi] plus research indicating that uva ursi can effectively treat and prevent urinary tract infections, suggest this herb can be helpful in treating [urinary incontinence](https://www.verywellhealth.com/bladder-control-and-urinary-incontinence-3300159)."4

Uva ursi is also known for its diuretic properties—this refers to the body’s ability to flush out fluids, which helps rid the bladder of disease-causing germs. [_E. coli_](https://www.verywellhealth.com/e-coli-symptoms-diagnosis-treatment-4174407) is a type of bacteria that commonly causes UTIs in females. Research has suggested that uva ursi can help prevent _E. coli_ as well.2
