# Growing

###### Why do farmers plant goldenrod?
Goldenrod attracts migrating butterflies and bees which are needed for crop pollination. Having lots of goldenrod around is crucial for fruit production.

### Light

Goldenrod craves [full sun](https://www.thespruce.com/what-is-full-sun-partial-shade-1402372) for optimal flowering. The plant will tolerate a bit of shade, though a shady location can reduce its blooms.

### Soil

Goldenrod is not overly picky about soil but it must be well-drained with a [pH](https://www.thespruce.com/importance-or-proper-soil-ph-2131096) in the acidic-to-neutral range. This plant can tolerate sandy, rocky, and clay soils. Very rich soil can cause the plant to become leggy and potentially flop over.

### Water

Water new goldenrod plants weekly to maintain damp, but not soggy soil. Mature goldenrod plants are drought tolerant and rarely need supplemental watering except when rainfall is scarce.

### Temperature and Humidity

The hardiness range varies a bit depending on the species, but most goldenrods thrive in [USDA cold hardiness zones](https://www.thespruce.com/find-your-usda-zone-3269819) 2 to 8.

### Fertilizer

Fertilizing goldenrod is typically not necessary because the plants do well in lean soil conditions. However, if the soil quality is poor or you wish to give your plants a boost to increase their height, add a layer of [compost](https://www.thespruce.com/compost-black-gold-for-your-garden-soil-1403130) in the spring.

Too much fertilization often leads to floppy green growth and reduces flower production.

## Pruning

Pruning stem tips early in the season can result in goldenrod plants becoming fuller and bushier and lead to more flowers later in the season. Deadheading spent flower heads can prolong the bloom season well into fall. Removing the flower heads before they go to seed can prevent rampant self-seeding. At the end of the season or in late winter, cut the plant stalks back to a few inches above ground level.

## Propagating Goldenrod

Use this process to propagate goldenrod by division in the spring:

1.  When new growth has just started, lift the entire plant out of the ground with a shovel. If it is too big to move in a single piece, do so in sections. Every section should have at least a couple of growth tips. 
2.  Shake off any excess soil, which helps to separate the rhizomes into smaller sections.
3.  Replant each section at the same depth as the original plant and water it well. Keep watering the division until you see new growth.  
    

You can also propagate goldenrod from cuttings:

1.  In the early summer, use clean garden shears to cut four-inch shoots from the base of the plant and dip the cut ends in [rooting hormone](https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-use-rooting-hormone-1902934). 
2.  Plant the cuttings about one inch deep in a four- to six-inch pot filled with potting mix and slowly water until the soil evenly moist and water starts to drip out of the drainage holes.
3.  Place the pot in a protected location out of direct sunlight and drying winds.
4.  Keep the soil moist at all times.
5.  When you see new growth, transplant the goldenrod into the garden.

## How to Grow Goldenrod From Seed

Growing goldenrod from seed is easy; the only requirement for most _Solidago_ species is a 60-day cold [stratification](https://www.thespruce.com/stratification-seeds-into-thinking-its-winter-1403100) period. This can be naturally achieved by sowing the seeds outdoors in a weed-free location in the late fall or early spring so the seeds are naturally exposed to prolonged cold, moist conditions.

Alternatively, you can artificially stratify the seeds by placing them in a sealed plastic bag outfitted with a damp paper towel, sand, or vermiculite. Store the bag in the refrigerator for 60 days at 40 degrees (or lower) Fahrenheit. After the stratification period, sow the seeds outdoors in early to mid-spring.

Sow the seeds shallow, no deeper than the width of the seed, and keep them evenly moist until seedlings emerge.

## Potting and Repotting Goldenrod

Because goldenrod is a vigorous spreader, gardeners sometimes grow it in pots where it can be contained better than in garden beds. Use a container at least 12 inches in diameter with large drainage holes. Unglazed clay is ideal because it lets excess moisture evaporate.

Fill the pot with a quality [potting mix](https://www.thespruce.com/potting-soil-indoor-plants-container-plants-1902802), place the plant in the pot, and backfill with the potting mix. Water the plant slowly and thoroughly until the soil is evenly moist. Like all container plants, even established goldenrod needs to be watered regularly, unlike in a garden setting.

When roots grow out of the drainage holes, or the plant becomes root-bound, transplant it to a larger pot, or divide it and replant a section of it in a pot of the same size with fresh potting soil.

## Overwintering

Goldenrod is a hardy plant up to USDA cold hardiness zone 2 and does not need protection unless grown in containers, in which case it is recommended to [winterize the containers](https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-overwinter-container-plants-1402050) to insulate the roots against freezing temperatures.

In the garden, the stems can be cut down to a few inches above ground level after frost kills the foliage. Removing the stems, including seed heads, will reduce self-seeding in the garden.

## Common Pests & Plant Diseases

Goldenrod is not bothered by serious pests or diseases but it can be affected by [rust fungus](https://www.thespruce.com/prevent-rust-fungus-1316106), [powdery mildew](https://www.thespruce.com/powdery-mildew-1402500), and leaf spot. These fungal diseases are usually tolerated, though spraying with fungicide is an option. Most species prefer drier soils, and root rot is a possibility in dense, damp soils.

Goldenrod can be attacked by beetles, aphids, and gall-forming insects, though the results are rarely fatal.

## How to Get Goldenrod to Bloom

Goldenrods are late-season bloomers producing their flowers from mid or late summer into fall, though the precise bloom period varies somewhat depending on species and cultivar. When these plants fail to bloom, it's usually because they don't receive enough sun. And like many native plants, excessive fertilizer can have a counterproductive effect by stimulating green growth but reducing flower production.

[Deadheading](https://www.thespruce.com/why-you-should-be-deadheading-plants-2132406) spent flower clusters can extend the bloom period right up to killing frost.

## Common Problems With Goldenrod

The most frequent issue arising with goldenrod is how to prevent it from spreading where you don't want it. Mature plants can spread via reseeding and underground [rhizomes](https://www.thespruce.com/rhizomes-definition-examples-2131103), potentially outcompeting other plants in the garden. To prevent this, grow goldenrod in containers or in a garden bed with barriers to contain the underground spread.

Another way to control the spread is to divide your goldenrod often, at least every two to three years, so it doesn't have the chance to expand. Also deadhead spent flower heads promptly to stop them from spreading their seeds if you don't want new plants to pop up. Or better yet, cut the flowers to use in floral arrangements.
