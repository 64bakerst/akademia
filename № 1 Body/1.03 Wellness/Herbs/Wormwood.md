#Wormwood 

**The _daily dosage_ is a _maximum_ of three grams of _wormwood_ herb**

-   Absinthe is a botanical spirit made from wormwood, anise and fennel, but that’s not all wormwood is good for. It’s used to eliminate intestinal worms, especially roundworms and pinworms, and it’s the source of of the key ingredient for the herbal drug artemisinin, which is the most powerful antimalarial on the market.
-   It’s also been shown to kill cancer cells and treat anorexia, insomnia, anemia, a lack of appetite, flatulence, stomach aches, jaundice and indigestion.


The active chemicals in wormwood include absinthin, anabsinthin (both [bitter](https://www.healthyhildegard.com/what-foods-are-bitter/) compounds), and a volatile oil that is 70% thujone.

Thujone is an active organic chemical that acts as an antagonist of the neurotransmitter GABA. GABA controls neuron excitability in your brain. When thujone limits GABA activity, your receptors in your nervous system become more active.

As a result, high doses of wormwood can cause excitability or nervousness and muscle spasms. In fact, toxic doses of thujone from wormwood in Absinthe is part of how Absinthe got its reputation for hallucinations and other effects. [Source](https://www.healthyhildegard.com/wormwood-benefits/)


Wormwood’s other active chemical compounds include:

-   acetylenes (chemicals that are naturally anti-parasitic)
-   tannins
-   ascorbic acid (vitamin C)
-   azulenes (aromatic compounds containing dark blue pigments)
-   carotenoids (nutritional organic compounds)
-   flavonoids like quercitin (bitter nutrient compound)
-   lignins
-   phenolic acids (aromatic acids)

### How to Make a Wormwood Room Spray

Wormwood is naturally antimicrobial and anti-fungal, so you can use wormwood as a spring-cleaning preparation to ward off potential illness. 

Combine one (1) teaspoon of dried (or 2 teaspoons fresh) wormwood along with chopped thyme, rosemary, and lavender together with 2-3 cloves. Add 1/2 liter of apple cider vinegar. Allow the mixture to sit for 3 to 4 weeks in a cool dark place.

Strain the juice into a mist or spray bottle. Lightly mist your living areas each morning to help create a clean air environment and strengthen the immune system.

# Benefits

Folklore prescribes wormwood for general deficiencies in digestive juices and malaise. There is some [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17240130) that indicates that wormwood benefits include easing the symptoms of crohn’s disease as well as _small intestine bacterial overgrowth_ or SIBO.

In addition, you can also use a wormwood tincture externally for wound cleansing and treating insect bites. Other wormwood benefits include:

-   Anti-inflammatory
-   Anti-pyretic (fever reducer)
-   Chemotherapeutic (kills cancer cells)
-   Anti-microbial & Anti-fungal (kills bacteria, viruses, and funguses)
-   Anti-parasitic (kills parasites)

##### Effects
- has sesquiterpene lactones, which weakens the parasite’s membrane making them confused and weak ^waslur
- Beats Malaria - Artemisinin is an extract isolated from Wormwood - the most powerful antimalarial on the market.  it reacts with the high levels of iron in the parasite to produce free radicals. The free radicals then destroy the cell walls of the malaria parasite. [~](https://draxe.com/nutrition/wormwood/)
- Fights Cancer Cells - artemisinin can battle iron-enriched breast cancer cells similar to the way it eliminates malaria-causing parasites. Cancer cells can also be rich in iron since they commonly soak it up to facilitate cell division. The normal cells showed little change, but within 16 hours, almost all of the cancer cells were dead and only a few normal cells were killed.
- Treats Crohn’s Disease - Researchers [found](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17240130) that there was a steady improvement in Crohn’s disease symptoms in 18 patients (90 percent) who received wormwood in spite of the decrease of steroids. After eight weeks of treatment with wormwood, there was almost complete remission of symptoms in 13 (65 percent) patients in this group as compared to none in the placebo group. This remission lasted until the end of the observation period, which was 20 weeks (12 weeks later), and the addition of steroids was not necessary.
- Contains Antimicrobial and Antifungal Abilities - Not only can wormwood kill bacteria, but it’s also been shown to kill fungi. Research [shows](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15740015) that essential oil distilled from the aerial parts of _Artemisia absinthium_ inhibited the growth of a very broad spectrum of tested fungi (11 to be exact). The wormwood essential oil also showed antioxidant properties during testing. Another study published in _Planta Medica_ [concludes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12624823) that _A. absinthium_ oil inhibits the growth of _Candida albicans_. This is the the most common type of yeast infection found in the mouth, intestinal tract and vagina, and it may affect skin and other mucous membranes.

# Precautions

Wormwood is generally regarded as safe for you when used appropriately for short durations. You should not take in large amounts or long-term. Other wormwood precautions to consider:

-   Do not take more than  3 grams or 60 tincture drops of wormwood per day.
-   Your daily regimen should not exceed a period of 2 weeks.
-   Do not consume wormwood during pregnancy.
-   Wormwood is unsafe for pregnant women because it has uterine and menstrual stimulating effects.
-   If you have a seizure disorder, consult your doctor before using wormwood.
-   If you are taking medications, particularly anti-convulsants (for seizures), wormwood may interfere with these medications.
-   To be safe, you should not use wormwood while breastfeeding.
-   If you are known to have [ragweed allergies](https://www.healthyhildegard.com/pollen-allergy/) (or other asteraceae plants) you may have allergic reactions to wormwood.
-   Wormwood is not recommended for people with kidney disorders.

### The Absinthe Myth

 The use of _Artemisia absinthium_ in a drink is attested in [Lucretius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucretius "Lucretius")' _[De Rerum Natura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Rerum_Natura "De Rerum Natura")_ (936–950), where Lucretius indicates that a drink containing wormwood is given as medicine to children in a cup with honey on the brim to make it drinkable.[11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absinthe#cite_note-11)
 
The first evidence of absinthe, in the sense of a distilled spirit containing green anise and fennel, dates to the 18th century. According to popular legend, it began as an all-purpose patent remedy created by Dr. Pierre Ordinaire, a French doctor living in [Couvet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couvet "Couvet"), Switzerland around 1792 (the exact date varies by account). Ordinaire's recipe was passed on to the Henriod sisters of Couvet, who sold it as a medicinal elixir. By other accounts, the Henriod sisters may have been making the elixir before Ordinaire's arrival. In either case, a certain Major Dubied acquired the formula from the sisters in 1797 and opened the first absinthe distillery named Dubied Père et Fils in Couvet with his son Marcellin and son-in-law Henry-Louis Pernod. In 1805, they built a second distillery in [Pontarlier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontarlier "Pontarlier"), France, under the company name Maison [Pernod Fils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pernod_Fils "Pernod Fils").[15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absinthe#cite_note-faqiii-15) Pernod Fils remained one of the most popular brands of absinthe until the drink was banned in France in 1914.

Absinthe's popularity grew steadily through the 1840s, when it was given to French troops as a malaria preventive. [16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absinthe#cite_note-16)

Certain absinthe marketers love to capitalize on their product’s most prevalent and illicit reputation, but it’s no more likely to make you see things than vodka, whiskey or tequila. Recent scientific studies—some of them co-authored by Breaux himself—“have demonstrated beyond doubt that pre-ban absinthes contained no hallucinogens, opiates or other psychoactive substances,” he says. “The most powerful ‘drug’ in absinthe is and has always been a high volume of neatly disguised, seductively perfumed alcohol.” [Source](https://www.liquor.com/articles/biggest-absinthe-myths/)

So if absinthe isn’t hallucinogenic, why was it banned in most European countries and the U.S. in the early 20th century? “Absinthe became a victim of its own popularity when the French wine industry and temperance movement targeted a common scapegoat to promote their respective agendas,” Breaux says. In reality, according to Breaux, it was “cheap, adulterated versions of the drink” sold by unscrupulous manufacturers—not unlike [bathtub gin during Prohibition](https://www.liquor.com/slideshows/prohibition-100th-anniversary/)—that caused problems.

Traditional absinthes were redistilled from a white grape spirit (or [eau de vie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eau_de_vie "Eau de vie")), while lesser absinthes were more commonly made from alcohol from grain, beets, or potatoes.[61](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absinthe#cite_note-61) The principal botanicals are [grande wormwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absinth_Wormwood "Absinth Wormwood"), [green anise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_anise "Green anise"), and [florence fennel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_fennel "Florence fennel"), which are often called "the holy trinity".[62](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absinthe#cite_note-62) Many other herbs may be used as well, such as petite wormwood (_[Artemisia pontica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemisia_pontica "Artemisia pontica")_ or Roman wormwood), [hyssop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyssop "Hyssop"), [melissa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon_balm "Lemon balm"), [star anise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_anise "Star anise"), [angelica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelica "Angelica"), [peppermint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peppermint "Peppermint"), [coriander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriander "Coriander"), and [veronica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veronica_(plant) "Veronica (plant)").[63](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absinthe#cite_note-63)


Absinthe has been frequently and improperly described in modern times as being [hallucinogenic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucinogenic "Hallucinogenic"). No peer-reviewed scientific study has demonstrated absinthe to possess hallucinogenic properties.[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absinthe#cite_note-84) The belief that absinthe induces hallucinogenic effects is rooted, at least partly, in the findings of 19th century French psychiatrist [Valentin Magnan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentin_Magnan "Valentin Magnan"), who carried out ten years of experiments with wormwood oil. In the course of this research he studied 250 cases of alcoholism and concluded that those who abused absinthe were worse off than those who abused other alcoholic drinks, experiencing rapid-onset hallucinations.[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absinthe#cite_note-85) Such accounts by opponents of absinthe (like Magnan) were cheerfully embraced by famous absinthe drinkers, many of whom were [bohemian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemian_culture "Bohemian culture") artists or writers.[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absinthe#cite_note-86)

Notions of absinthe's alleged hallucinogenic properties were again fuelled in the 1970s, when a scientific paper suggested that [thujone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thujone "Thujone")'s structural similarity to [tetrahydrocannabinol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahydrocannabinol "Tetrahydrocannabinol") (THC), the active chemical in [cannabis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug) "Cannabis (drug)"), presented the possibility of THC receptor affinity.[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absinthe#cite_note-88)[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absinthe#cite_note-thc-89) This theory was conclusively disproven in 1999.[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absinthe#cite_note-90)

##### Toxicity

Most [chemotypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotype "Chemotype") of _A. absinthium_ contain (−)-α- and/or (+)-β-[thujone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thujone "Thujone"),[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemisia_absinthium#cite_note-25) though some do not.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemisia_absinthium#cite_note-26) (−)-α-Thujone by itself is a GABAA receptor antagonist that can cause [convulsions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convulsions "Convulsions") and death when administered in large amounts to animals and humans.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemisia_absinthium#cite_note-27) However, there is only one case of documented toxicity of wormwood involving a 31-year-old man who drank 10 mL of steam-distilled volatile oil of wormwood, wrongly believing it was absinthe liqueur.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemisia_absinthium#cite_note-28) Medicinal extracts of wormwood have not been shown to cause seizure or other adverse effects at usual doses.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemisia_absinthium#cite_note-29) Thujones have not been shown to be the cause of excessive doses' toxicity for any kind of wormwood extracts, including absinthe.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemisia_absinthium#cite_note-30)
