root:: [[Amino Acids]]

---

-  the most abundant amino acid in the bloodstream. It makes up 30 percent to 35 percent of the amino acid nitrogen in your blood.
- essential when an individual faces disease or specifically muscle wasting. This can happen in the course of certain diseases or even physical trauma.
- 60 percent of your skeletal muscle is made up of glutamine
-  aid protein synthesis and help naturally balance your pH levels.


# Benefits
#### Improves Gastrointestinal and Immune Health
- supporting gut function and digestive processes
-  [play an important role](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6834172/) in maintaining healthy gut microbiota and immunity
- [reduces intestinal inflammation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10600341) and can help people recover from food sensitivities.
- 
#### Treat Leaky Gut and Ulcers
- L-glutamine [benefits ulcerative colitis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7627502) and inflammatory bowel disease.
- L-glutamine is the No. 1 amino acid you need to help heal and repair it.

#### Supports Brain Health
- A precursor to the neurotransmitter glutamate in your brain, glutamine is key to boosting your brain health
- Glutamine can also help stall brain aging.
- even mild traumatic brain injury caused brain atrophy, and most of this damage was [due to the disrupted glutamine-glutamate cycle](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29420817) and an abnormal increase in glutamate levels.
#### Improve IBS Symptoms and Diarrhea
- [balancing mucus production](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14583848). This results in healthier bowel movements.
- If you have Hashimoto’s or an underactive thyroid, consider making it a part of your hypothyroidism diet. The same goes for anyone who suffers from IBS symptoms like constant diarrhea or ulcerations.
#### Promotes Muscle Growth and Decreases Muscle Wasting
- After an intense workout, the levels of cellular glutamine can drop by 50 percent and plasma levels by 30 percent. This muscle-wasting state is a gateway for the body to use your muscle for energy rather than carbohydrates, but glutamine [can help prevent this](https://digitalcommons.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4782&context=gradschool_theses) from happening.
- Supplementing with L-glutamine allows your muscles to fight and push a bit further. This boosts your strength and helps repair your skeletal muscles.
- A study found that glutamine supplementation makes it possible to recover quicker from intense weight training sessions because it [improves muscle hydration](http://jap.physiology.org/content/86/6/1770). This aids the [muscle recovery](https://draxe.com/fitness/muscle-recovery/) process and [reduces recovery time](http://jn.nutrition.org/content/131/9/2543S.full) for wounds and burns.
#### Improve Athletic Performance and Recovery from Endurance Exercise
- support detoxification by cleansing the body from high levels of ammonia
- It [acts as a buffer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9778582) and converts excess ammonia into other amino acids, amino sugars and urea.
- Doing approximately one hour of exercise can cause a 40 percent reduction of glutamine in the body
