Same as Tums and other calcium supplements but without extra ingredients. When you take calcium with fat it prevents some of it from being absorbed, so you lose both the calcium and the fat. Calcium increases the need for Magnesium so you should not take a lot of calcium unless you also take magnesium or you will have trouble sleeping and other issues.

This is also useful if you want to make your own mineral or electrolyte water, a little sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium in a drink to replace minerals.
