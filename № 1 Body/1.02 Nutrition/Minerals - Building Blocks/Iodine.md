# Benefits
-  Iodine kills the bacteria in water by disrupting the ionic balance within the pathogenic cells. It replaces the chemicals necessary for the bacteria or virus to thrive with iodide ions. ^wygyub

Iodine tablets and drops are a very popular choice for various reasons:
-   kills most viruses and bacteria with little effort
-   more effective and quicker than chlorine


1.  **Filtering your water to remove the larger pieces of debris prior to adding the iodine is ideal.** Pathogens tend to cling to large particles so removing them makes the iodine more effective, faster. You don’t want to drink chunks of stuff anyway.

# Precautions
- The lethal dose of free iodine for an adult human of 2 to 3 grams (2000-3000 mg) free iodine represents 40 to 60 mL (less than 2 fluid ounces) of 5% Lugol's solution.
- **Iodine only kills living pathogens.** If water is contaminated with poisons such as fertilizers or pesticides, [heavy metals](https://www.survivopedia.com/svpbananafilter/), certain parasites, radiation, or other forms of toxins, iodine isn’t going to help.
- Iodine, like chlorine and bromine, is a "halogen" - its Atomic number is 53 on the periodic element chart - All halogens are TOXIC.
-  Iodine, as all Halogens, is ineffective for treatment of water infected with parasitic worm eggs
-  not effective against parasitic worm eggs and larvae.
-  not effective against Cryptosporidium – a waterborne, disease spreading protozoan that contaminates drinking water supplies, causing intestinal infections in human beings and domestic animals.
- has a low to moderate effect against Giardia lamblia - a  protozoan parasite that colonizes and reproduces in the small intestine, causing diarrheal illness known as giardiasis.
- tastes bad - some people counter the taste by adding vitamin C, but you must be sure to add the vitamin C after the iodine has had time to be effective,  Vitamin C is a de-halogen and can actually neutralize the iodine's ability to purify your water
- not recommended for use by pregnant women or individuals with thyroid problems.
- Iodine Allergy - Some people are allergic to iodine - if you're allergic to shell fish you probably shouldn't use this method of water purification.  Symptoms of allergic reaction can vary from a runny nose and itchy, watery eyes to anaphylactic shock.
- does not remove or neutralize agricultural and industrial chemicals, or heavy metals from water.
- can react with certain contaminants causing residual chemicals or byproducts in drinking water after treatment is complete
- effectiveness depends on the water temperature - iodine disperses slower in colder water
- can lose effectiveness after a certain amount of time.  Exposure to heat, humidity, moisture, and air will reduce the effectiveness of iodine tablets.

# Detox Protocol
## Salt Loading & Companion Nutrients several weeks before Iodine Detox
##### Companion nutrients
- 3,000mg vitamin C
- 200mcg selenium
- 300-600mg magnesium oxide (I didn’t take this, as an online diet analyser showed that I was already getting more than 600mg magnesium in my diet, and I managed fine without it.)
- 500mg niacin (B3) twice a day – start by taking a much lower amount to see how your body reacts to it. (I still can’t take more than 200mg without getting a sharp hot flush and itchy rash.)
- 100mg B2 three times a day (I only take 200mg B2 a day, and it turns my pee neon yellow.)
- 1/2 teaspoon unprocessed sea salt added to the diet. It’s very important to use unrefined salt, as table salt is refined, which means essential minerals have been removed.
### Salt Loading
- Dissolve 1/4 teaspoon of unrefined, unprocessed sea salt or Himalayan salt in about 4 fluid ounces or half a cup of warm water.
- Follow this immediately with 12-16oz of pure water.
- This should trigger copious urination – if not, repeat in 30-45 minutes, and repeat again if necessary.
### Iodine Intake
- starting with 12.5mg of iodine (such as Iodorol, Iodorx or Lugol’s) each day, and increasing the dose by 12.5mg every week.
## Pulse Dosing
- Many people who undergo the Iodine Protocol cease taking iodine for 48 hours every week, but continue with the salt loading and taking the companion nutrients during this time. This is known as “pulse-dosing” and it can help alleviate the detox symptoms.
## Clearing Chlorine Blocks
- Drinking Water
	- Binchotan charcoal is said to remove elements like chlorine from water by attracting the negative ions to the surface of the charcoal. It also neutralises the water’s pH levels.
	- After three months of use, the stick has to be boiled in water for 10 minutes, after which it can be used again for a further three months.
- Shower & Bath Filters
	- https://www.pureshowers.co.uk/bath-ball-bath-filter.html
	- You have to swoosh it around the bath for three minutes before getting in. It lasts for 12 months or up to 400 baths.
## Clearing Mercury Blocks


# Support Minerals
- Selenium is necessary for the production of powerful antioxidants such as glutathione.
- A lack of selenium (selenium deficiency) may set you up for inflammation in the thyroid gland if you are also using iodine.
- As long as you replete your selenium (and zinc and other nutrient deficiencies) before you take iodine this shouldn't be an issue.
- In addition to this, you should carry out the Salt Loading Protocol twice a day while detox symptoms continue. This is a very important part of the detoxification process.

# Best Dosage
- http://dropulator.com/old/
- For 70-80% of thyroid patients (especially those who are supplementing regularly with zinc and selenium) then starting out in the **6mg to 12.5mg** range shouldn't pose any problem. I would recommend 1 capsule per day of a supplement such as this which contains both iodide and iodine. 
  If you have experienced issues with iodine in the past or you are sensitive to small doses of medications and supplements then you will want to start out with 100mcg per day and slowly increase your dose over time. You should still be able to get to higher doses over time but it may take a while. 
  At this time I have no recommendations for using doses of iodine higher than **12.5mg** per day.
## Low Dose
- Some people are just taking tiny amounts of iodine, possibly with or without supporting nutrients, and staying there at 100’s of mcg, that’s it.
- Getting tiny amounts of iodine and other nutrients may be better than nothing. But some people are using pretty large amounts of iodine and other nutrients for years in order to clean out some potent toxicities. Starting iodine at these lower doses and hanging out here for a few months may help prepare our cells for more cleaning with more iodine, but staying at tiny doses isn’t going to do much against the toxicities we face today.


## Medium Dose
- Dosage
	- The guidelines are to build up the intake of iodine gradually, starting with 12.5mg of iodine (such as Iodorol, Iodorx or Lugol’s) each day, and increasing the dose by 12.5mg every week.
	- a daily dose of between 12 and 50mg a day for iodine deficient adults
	- There are several reasons to suggest that high doses of iodine in the 6mg to 12.5mg range are healthy, safe, and effective.
	- There are studies from certain populations of Japanese (8) which show that these populations consume anywhere from 1 milligrams to 12 milligrams of iodine every day (depending on which study you look at) and have low rates of breast cancer (9) (where iodine concentrates) and thyroid disease.
	- Mainland Japanese people are believed to consume approximately 13.8mg of iodine daily, more than 10 times the WHO recommended dose, mainly from seaweed. The Japanese have relatively low levels of breast, endometrial and ovarian cancers, and Japanese women have significantly lower levels of fibrocystic breast disease.
	- Even if you opt to use higher doses of iodine (in the 6mg to 12.5mg range) you don't have to use it every day.
	- You can break up your dose to obtain an average smaller dose simply by taking it once per week or on some similar schedule.
	- Once a week dosing with 12.5mg of iodine will provide your body with an average dose of 1.7mg per day of iodine.
	- Once per month dosing of 12.5mg of iodine will provide your body with an average dose of around 400mcg of iodine each day.
	- My wife on the other hand, who does have thyroid disease, takes the same supplement which contains 12.5mg of iodine each and every day.
- Experience
	- I started the supporting nutrients for about a week, and then I tried 1 drop of Lugols 2% on my forearm. I waited about 24 hours just to see how my body responded. Then I started 1 drop of 2% in a glass of water per day. Then each week, I added 1 drop of 2% to my daily.
	- Anytime I ran into detox, I would pause iodine and look for nutrients that helped me with whatever symptoms I was feeling. This was working great, but then I tried high dose..
	- A few months into this at about 35mg of daily iodine, I started getting the same symptoms that lead me to iodine. I panicked a bit because I didn’t like the way those symptoms make me feel. Without knowing what else to do, I tried the community’s suggestions of higher doses of iodine.
	- Over the course of almost 2 weeks, I consumed close to 2,000mg of iodine total. I wasn’t feeling better and continued to feel off, so I stopped. 3 days later I woke up feeling like I was hit by a bus. Long story short, I dislodged a ton of mainly mercury. I laid on the couch assuming I was dying for a week, and then happened to eat 6 hard-boiled eggs one night and woke up the next morning feeling 80% better. This led me to realize mainly the sulfur and zinc in the eggs bound to the mercury I knocked loose with iodine and allowed me to digest/clear it. For the next month, I used epsom salt and black sesame seeds for sulfur and zinc etc, and had to be careful how much I would take or my butt would burn too much from the metals being passed.
	- I was lucky to find the nutrients that happened to work for acute poisoning from high dose iodine knocking loose a hidden toxicity.
	- So now, what I think makes the most sense for increasing my iodine levels, is only getting as much iodine as my body can currently handle the detox of. I listen to the detox symptoms and use them to find the nutrition my body is asking for, instead of blasting past it with high dose, which only seems to wrap it up in fat temporarily till we stop taking iodine daily.


## High Dose
- Dosage
	- Very high doses of iodine would include doses that range from 25 mg (milligrams per day) all the way up to 50 mg (milligrams) per day.
	- The medium doses of iodine are sufficient to help with repletion and should be preferred over very high doses of iodine.
	- The general idea of high-dose is starting at 50mg of Lugols. But even starting above 12.5mg is still a pretty high.
- Experience
	- I have a feeling high-dose iodine is able to dislodge toxins via additional gene activity as well as apoptosis and wrap them in fat. I think as we continue to take that amount of iodine, we’re able to hold onto those toxins suspended in fat. This may come in handy at clearing a specific issue, possibly helping us clean up situations that are draining our energy or could otherwise require invasive interventions.
	- But we’re carrying around these toxins to begin with because we don’t have the nutrients to run the cells to detox the toxins, and although we’ve stripped them out with iodine and have them suspended in fat, we still don’t have the ability to process them and get them out.
	- At this point we’re temporarily suspending toxins in fat, which is great if its helping us feel better, but we need to get this stuff out. Some of us do not seem to be able to wrap toxins in fat at all or for long. Some people using high doses are fine for several months, and then they’re body drops the toxins it’s been suspending and the person feels horrible without understanding why.
	- Getting this stuff out requires either working with someone that can help us, or studying how our body works well enough that we’re able to reverse engineer our symptoms. By understanding how to support our body’s ability to generate enough glutathione, we should find areas of our metabolism that are familiar to us as we pay attention to how our own system works.

## Pulse Dosing
- Pulse Dosing is the idea that we figure out how much our body wants of a specific nutrient. It also allows our body to use up the nutrients so levels can come back down, avoiding potentially getting a bit too much of certain nutrients.
- Over time, I realized I only need to take a 200mcg selenomethionine two to four times a month. If I take it less than that, I start to feel symptoms, and if I take it much more than that, I feel symptoms of overload. I recently tried a different form of selenium, which is only 50mcg, so I take it every few days.
- On average, I only take about 6mg of iodine daily and don’t even take it every single day. And then once a week or so, I’ll take a larger dose of 20 or 50mg just to see how my body responds.
- This is similar to watering houseplants. If we don’t water them, they dry up. If we water them too much, they leak or become waterlogged. But with practice and observation, we can find the sweet spot in the middle. More about Pulse Dosing at whyiodine.com/pulse-dosing

# Side Effects
- These side effects do not mean that you need to stop using iodine but they may be an indication that you should back off on your dose.
- Low doses of iodine don't seem to have a strong effect on the thyroid gland but higher doses may start to impact both thyroid function and your thyroid gland.
- The thyroid gland has a protective mechanism built-in which blocks the update of excessive doses of iodine to prevent states of hyperthyroidism.
- Moderately high doses of iodine can trigger this response and may explain specific changes in thyroid function in the short term.
- But just because this can happen doesn't mean you should be scared of it occurring.
- Even when it does occur this effect tends to be minimal.
- In addition, and at least in my experience, you are much more likely to experience positive side effects (such as an increased production of thyroid hormone) as opposed to negative side effects.
- Other side effects with iodine use may include:
	- Fatigue
	  Nausea
	  Rashes/hives
	  Sensation that your thyroid is swollen (if this occurs you should stop iodine supplementation)
	  These side effects can and should be minimal if you are using appropriate doses of iodine but you should be aware of them.
	- The side effects listed above tend to stem from the thyroid gland directly.
- But it is my opinion that taking iodine by mouth may also have a direct impact on existing thyroid hormone that is already produced in your body.
- This may be why some individuals who take iodine notice an almost immediate improvement in their symptoms.
- The reason that this may occur is probably related to the structure of iodine and how it may displace other halides which share a similar electron outer shell.
- It has been theorized (but not proven to my knowledge) that halides (bromine, chlorine, fluorine) may displace iodine on thyroid hormones molecules.
- This may happen because all of these chemicals contain a similar electrical charge.
- Normally, each thyroid hormone contains 4 (for thyroxine) or 3 (for triiodothyronine) iodine molecules on it.
- But you can imagine that, in some instances, one or more of these iodine molecules may be displaced by these other chemicals.
- If that occurs they may render the thyroid hormone molecule inactive which would then cause a mismatch between your thyroid lab tests and your clinical presentation.
- Imagine if even a small number of thyroid molecules in your body were inactive.
- Your lab tests might show that your serum levels of T4 and T3 were normal but they wouldn't be able to tell you how well these molecules are working.
- By giving yourself iodine, in supplement form, you could create an environment where these halides might be displaced from thyroid hormone molecules and render them active again due to competitive binding.
- If this occurs (and I believe there's good reason to believe it does) then the use of iodine could almost instantly improve thyroid function in your body through this mechanism.
- When I used high doses of iodine I noticed breakouts in my skin that would appear and quickly disappear within a day or so.
- And these skin changes were consistent with a condition known as bromoderma which is what occurs when your body eliminates excess bromide (a halide).
- When it does occur I've seen patients tend to experience a quick rush of negative symptoms (flu-like symptoms, breakouts, acne, feeling fatigued, and so on) as the body attempts to eliminate these halides out.
- So if you've ever experienced these symptoms while taking iodine it may actually be a good thing related to a detox-like reaction and not a negative side effect or even a reason to stop using iodine.
