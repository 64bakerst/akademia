		- What is a Sun Number?
		  The number that guides you
		  In Numerology, there is the same classification of personality traits. We call it your "Sun Number." Also based on the day and month you were born, your Sun Number is represented by a single-digit number, 1 - 9. Your number (and those of your friends) is easy to calculate. More importantly it describes your personality traits and those of similar Sun Numbers at a high and simplified level. By looking at the combined numbers of the day and month of birth, Numerology deduces the first pattern of your existence -- the day you entered this world.
		- The Sun Number is considered the first and less detailed pattern of who you are. Obviously, the world is made up millions and billions of unique individuals. However, the Sun Number brings our high-level characters and categorizes them into 9 groups (similar to Astrologyâ€™s 12 zodiac signs). And like in Astrology, as you provide more and more details of the day of your birth and your name, you uncover the underpinnings of what makes you, not just a Sun Number, but a truly unique and complex person.
		- How does the Sun Number work with other numbers in my Numerology chart?
		  Within the dynamic environment of personal and universal cycles affecting you in different ways, constantly bringing change and sometimes chaos, your Sun Number is your anchor. Think of it as the location where you stand, while everything around you is in motion. Your Sun Number also reveals how you approach the changing cycles and how they tend to influence you. For example, if your Sun Number is 1, you tend to take opportunities and challenges head on. You don't hesitate, you don't back down, and you generally don't ask for help. On the other hand, if your Sun Number is 2, you tend to deal with changing circumstances by carefully weighing the pros and cons, asking others for their opinions, and then, when you are ready, you take the necessary steps.
		  Who discovered the Sun Number?
		  Master Numerologist Hans Decoz, introduced the Sun Number as part of his life-long research and dedication to the art and mastery of Numerology. With over 40+ years of experience and witnessing countless testimonies of people whose lives were being radically changed -- for the better -- from his works, Hans felt it was important the he introduce an even broader access point for his teachings. The combination of birth month and birth date are used in many Numerology calculations, and thanks to Hans Decoz, now this base number has a name.
		- The Sun Number was the perfect way to unite people and help them see even the most obvious patterns we have as a species. He discovered that by staring at the Sun Number level, he was able to better help people tune into their baseline personalities and introduce them to the more subtle and complex numbers in their life. Just like knowing you have a predisposition toward anything in life, knowing your Sun Number can help make sense of why you make the choices you make and feel the way you feel.
		- Sun Number 1

		- People with a Sun Number 1 tend to have a stubborn, headstrong approach to changing circumstances. They often take the bull by the horns with a "damn the torpedoes" attitude. Strong and motivated, 1s are not afraid of confrontations. And at times, 1s can be too impulsive.
		- 1s have energy to spare, with enough stamina to survive even the toughest times. However, there is a limit to what they can do, and when a person with Sun Number 1 reaches that limit, they tend to shatter without much advance warning. And once they crash, it takes a long time to pick up the pieces and start the healing.
		- Sun Number 1s respond quickly, but don't always recognize the true nature of upcoming changes until they have already set things in motion. A 1 should learn to recognize the subtle signs that usually appear ahead of the storm.
		- Pride can be the downfall of this headstrong number. Successful Sun Number 1s have learned the need to be humble and remember that much has been given to them.
		  In love, the Sun Number 1 is passionate, but needs to dominate -- and it has a bit of jealous streak. While the 1 Sun Number is original and creative, it could use a more subtle and romantic approach. The 1 is anything but intuitive and has a tendency to misread his or her partner.
		- The most compatible Sun Numbers for the 1 are 2, 3, 5, 7 and 9; all odd numbers except for the 2, which happens to be its most fitting romantic partner.
		  The 1 Sun Number can be quite demanding, yet it is also extremely protective of its partner. The one trait that is pretty much guaranteed to ruin a relationship with the 1 is when he or she feels a lack of respect or sense that he or she is being taken for granted. Otherwise, the 1 has a thick skull and an even thicker skin. You can be as direct as you want to be -- the 1 can handle it.
		- Sun Number 2

		- People with a Sun Number 2 take a careful and deliberate approach to changes. Weighing the pros and the cons, 2s consider future consequences, then, and only then, they make their moves. 2 personalities tend to avoid direct confrontations, preferring instead to apply tact and diplomacy. They have no trouble drawing support from others, and share their troubles and their successes easily.
		- Sun Number 2s are intuitive and often sense changes before they become evident. Understanding of human nature and a cunning intellect generally serves this number well. But if not careful, it is this trait that could easily tempt a 2 into conning others into doing things they later regret.
		- 2s have a good sense of timing, which is a key survival skill. However, they often surrender to the inevitable quickly and sometimes allow themselves to be beaten down without much of a fight. But a 2's strength is resilient and they will quickly rise again. Sun Number 2s are sympathetic to the plight of others, but if tempted, they can easily fall prey to selfish and greedy tendencies.
		  When it comes to love, the 2 Sun Number is a highly intuitive, sensitive and romantic partner who should be handled with kid's gloves. The 2 is emotionally vulnerable in general, but especially in romance. The 2 looks right through anything that is not sincere and genuine, so playing games with a 2 will get you in hot water. At the same time, while typically against confrontation (preferring diplomacy and tact over the in-your-face approach), the 2 has a hard edge as well -- one that allows it to take a stand and not budge toward a compromise.
		  The 2 Sun Number is highly sensual and tends to put his or her partner first. Not particularly passionate, the 2 still knows how to please -- and how to be pleased. Always keep in mind that the 2 is fragile, and if you break it, you will have to deal with some dangerously sharp fragments.
		- All in all, Sun Numbers 1, 5, 6, 8, and 9, have the best chance of stealing the heart of a 2
		- Sun Number 3

		- People with a Sun Number 3 are innovative and creative. They think outside the box and find solutions quickly. Bubbling with optimism, a 3 person typically has a childish streak that lets them avoid their responsibilities, especially those that demand effort and attention. 3s tend to be loved by many, but often their own love for others tends to be somewhat superficial.
		  Sun Number 3s like to skate the surface, using their considerable sense of humor to keep things light and sunny. However, when hit by one of life's more serious challenges, a 3 will surprise everyone by displaying a lot more endurance, courage and determination than anyone expected -- including themselves.
		- Hands down, creativity is a 3's biggest asset when it comes to taking advantage of opportunities, or overcoming obstacles. Unfortunately, the effort level doesn't always live up to it. As a result, 3s leave quite a few unfinished projects, unfulfilled dreams, and empty promises behind in their path.
		- Successful Sun Number 3s have learned to focus and be disciplined in how they approach changing circumstances. When a 3 does manage to push something all the way to its goal, that accomplishment tends to be enormously satisfying.
		  In love, the 3 Sun Number may appear somewhat superficial and flaky when it gets involved in a romantic relationship, but that's just hiding a more serious undertone. The 3 Sun Number tends to be a happy, upbeat number, but also understands how vulnerable that happiness can be. For that reason, they dread pessimism and negativity, and approach any major change in life -- which a romantic relationship can be -- with caution. Sun Number 3s have no trouble entering into a romantic relationship they know is not meant to last. In fact, the 3 can certainly become a bit promiscuous, but when a 3 senses that it might become more serious, he or she will back off. The way to get a 3 to commit to a long-term relationship is by being patient and absolutely not demanding.
		- The 1, 3, 5, and 7 are the most suitable romantic Sun Numbers to pair up with the skittish 3.
		- Sun Number 4

		- Share113
		- People with a Sun Number 4 are sticklers for details and take a systematic, efficient approach to whatever comes their way. They are solid and stable, and it takes a major change to knock a 4 off his or her feet. However, 4s have a dislike of changes, preferring to maintain the status quo. For that reason, they are not always quick to catch on. 4s will most likely miss opportunities because they waited too long. Their biggest asset is the willingness to put forth considerable effort.
		- 4s are not procrastinators and tend to apply themselves with focus and dedication. Demanding much from themselves, 4s are not satisfied until they are the best at what they do. Sometimes this passion for perfection can make a 4 easily frustrated and not much fun to be around when they are working.  4s struggle with the concept of relaxation and tend to be all work and no play.
		- A less desirable quality of a 4 Sun Number is that they can be cruel and lack empathy. However, what others donâ€™t know is that they are equally as demanding of themselves as they are of others. It isn't so much that 4s are materialistic, but that they consider accomplishments to be the crux of all existence.
		- Successful Sun Number 4s have learned to accept that nothing is guaranteed in life, and that if you want to fulfill your dreams, you may have to take a risk every now and then.
		- The 4 Sun Number is comfortable and secure in most settings ... with the exception of romance. In love, the grounded 4 just doesn't know how to handle itself when the earth falls away and love takes it to the sky. It takes time for a 4 Sun Number to reveal what is in his or her heart. However, once they fall in love, the 4 tends to stay in love. They are not particularly passionate, nor are they sensual, but they more than make up for that with the intensity of their devotion. If you are on the receiving end of a 4 Sun Number's affections, you will never have to worry about its depth or the strength of its commitment. Solid as a rock, the 4 Sun Number will always be there for you.
		- All in all, the 5, 6 and 8 tend to be the more suitable partners for a 4 Sun Number.
		- Sun Number 5
		  by Hans Decoz

		- Of all the different Sun Numbers, the 5 is the one best equipped to deal with changes. Not only that, 5s thrive on them, because they tend to operate best in an environment that is both dynamic and somewhat chaotic. Sun Number 5s don't do well following a carefully planned path and are much better at responding to the moment. 5s are adrenalin junkies at heart. They love to travel and move about. A typical 5 is social, enjoys the company of others, and prefers to take a road they have not driven or walked before, even if that means making a bit of detour.
		- Sun Number 5s really don't like routine, or anything predictable for that matter. They have a wild streak and lack discipline. This can cause problems in the form of addiction or self-indulgence.
		- The most obvious short-coming of is 5 is their dislike of stability and responsibility. Successful Sun Number 5s have learned to dedicate their energy without wasting it on short-lived goals.
		- When it comes to romance, the 5 Sun Number is the most sensual and passionate of all numbers. In a romantic relationship, the 5 surprises everyone. As wild and adventurous as the 5 is in almost all areas of life, it becomes just as serious and committed when the heart is touched. The 5 is loyal to a fault, and while it is sometimes found on the receiving end of a cheating relationship, it is almost never the cheater. It is, of course, in the nature of the 5 Sun Number to try everything and everyone first, and for that reason, they usually don't become involved in a serious relationship until relatively late in life. But once the heart, as opposed to certain other body parts, is touched, the 5 no longer plays, but becomes a stable, focused and fully matured partner.
		- Nothing bothers a 5 more than being taken for granted, or being limited in any form. Freedom is a 5â€™s most prized asset, and they will do anything to keep it. 5s are not good at long-term relationships, but when they are in one, they are loyal and fun. Their adventurous personality makes them sensual and they appreciate the good things of life.
		- The 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7, are the most likely Sun Numbers to end up as the lucky winners of the heart of this born lover.
		- Sun Number 6
		  by Hans Decoz
		  PrintPrint EmailEmail
		- Share146
		- 6s are the most harmonious of all Sun Numbers, and have a tendency to ignore their own needs and desires in favor of helping and teaching others. They are the glue that binds. Their ability to love is what makes others love and respect them. People with a Sun Number 6 are born caregivers. Stable and level-headed, they deal well with changes. However, a 6 can be annoyingly self-righteous and may have a tendency to claim a spot on the totem pole before they have earned it. 6s can also be a bit short-sighted, lacking the ability to see the larger picture.
		  6s take their responsibilities seriously, perhaps a bit too seriously. Many people with a 6 Sun Number gravitate toward careers in construction and transportation. This is quite telling, as their inner nature is a bit like that -- a closed and restricted environment with peepholes to the outside world.
		- A 6â€™s strongest asset is their good and down-to-earth humanity. They
		  are idealists, but not without a sense of realism. They can be very patient, especially when it comes to working toward a far-away goal.
		- Often, 6s consider their own little pond to be all there is in the world. From an early age, Sun Number 6 personalities are fascinated and drawn to organized belief systems. As a result, they have adopted parts and pieces of dogmas and concepts that potentially restrict their vision. Successful Sun Number 6s must learn to occasionally step out of their environment, and escape the safety net of a potentially narrow view of life.
		- And when it comes to romance, the 6 Sun Number takes love as seriously as it takes everything else. The most loving and harmonious of all numbers, the 6 gives itself fully and without restraint. At the same time, to the surprise and detriment of its partner, the 6 can be rather promiscuous, due to the simple fact that it doesn't always know how not to give of itself.
		- The 6 Sun Number has broken more hearts than any other Sun Number, but it has also brought great pleasure and happiness to more lovers, albeit not always long-lived, than any other number. When the 6 can learn to give more, and to give more of itself, this giving nature becomes the biggest strength of the 6 Sun Number. If you are lucky enough to be the last lover standing, the 6 will care for you and love you like no other.
		- The 2, 5, 6, 7, and 9, all have a shot at this prize, with the 7 and 9 as the most likely survivors to win the heart of a Sun Number 6.
		- Sun Number 7

		- Share192
		- The world of philosophy and spiritual awareness is a 7â€™s domain. People with the Sun Number 7 don't take anything at face value and tend to search for a deeper meaning in everything. Changes don't bother a 7, but the seeming apathy for change sometimes means they donâ€™t get the attention they require. A 7 may be an introvert hiding an extrovert or vice versa, either way, both sides exist within this person. They are dreamers, but not materialistic; their dreams are more utopian and lofty.
		- Few things bother a Sun Number 7 more than being in an environment of superficial lightweights and noisy extroverts. They know there is nothing to be found there but wasted time and energy. Often opinionated to a fault, 7s tend to have a handful of close friends, while everyone else is a stranger. Interestingly, while they tend to control, if not hide, their emotional side, many with a 7 Sun Number choose the fields of psychology and psychiatry.
		- 7s are extremely curious and have a scholarly nature, but not a conventional one. In fact, there is very little conventional about a 7, as they are often more eccentric.
		- Successful Sun Number 7s have learned to embrace their emotions. Not everything can be solved by the mind alone.
		- In love, the Sun Number 7 is often a late bloomer. Its interests are mostly on the spiritual and intellectual planes, not so much the physical. So when a 7 finally falls in love, it doesn't really know how to handle it, and as a result, tends to try for a platonic relationship first. Fortunately, once the ice is broken and the physical side of the romance comes to life, the 7 proves to be a great lover, extremely giving and caring and focused on one thing and one thing only: the happiness of its partner. As with anything else the 7 tries, it will work on becoming the best, and the 7 is no different in romance. The 7 is very considerate and, a truly invaluable asset, conscious of the needs and expectations of its partner.
		- The Sun Number 7 tends to fall in love much less often than any of the other numbers, but when it happens, it takes over and becomes its first and foremost priority. And who wouldn't want to play that role? If you are a 1, 3, 5, 6, 7 or 9, you have a chance of snaring the heart of a 7. Rather a large pool, but the 7 is worth some extra effort.
		- Sun Number 8

		- Share102
		- People with the Sun Number 8 have an authoritarian streak and like to be in charge at all times. Unfortunately, changes can't always be controlled, and when they feel they don't have control, watch out! They become agitated and angry. An 8 can be aggressive, if not bullish, and they have paid a price for that more than once. They are capable and smart, and often able to see the larger picture well before anyone else does.
		- A sense of balance allows 8s to deal with the material world without the kind of attachment most people are burdened with. It's this trait that lets 8s take chances and use their assets and resources in a way others might consider too risky. 8s like to get in on the ground floor of new ventures. Sometimes they are too quick and/or optimistic, setting expectations too high and resulting in disappointment. But even these failures canâ€™t sideline an 8 for long.
		- It is perhaps a bit of a contradiction, but 8s have trouble accepting the authority of other individuals or institutions. This has led some with an 8 Sun Number to a path of crime and incarceration. Successful Sun Number 8s are careful to not to let anger cloud their judgment.
		- The 8 Sun Number is not an easy one to please when it comes to romance. This is mostly due to the fact that he or she simply doesn't show much of what he or she is feeling. The 8 tends to be level headed, something that can take the wind out of a passionate romantic relationship. If, however, the partner has enough self-confidence and is secure in his or her own right, the relationship can last forever.
		  The 8 is neither demanding, nor particularly giving. It considers sex the way it looks at all other needs of the flesh: satisfy it, then move on. On the other hand, the 8 has a strong sense of commitment, takes care of those around him or her, and will fight to protect them. Having an 8 Sun Number on your side is reason to feel safe and secure. Really, the 2 is the ideal partner for an 8 Sun Number -- all others will have to work on it.
		- Sun Number 9
		  by Hans Decoz

		- Share126
		- People with a Sun Number 9 are idealists. There is a global consciousness that drives many with a 9 Sun Number to a career in politics, the military or law enforcement. They can be aloof and distant, but that is a form of self-defense, because they are often not very good with emotional issues, preferring a more clinical and objective approach.
		- 9s like things to be well thought out, carefully strategized, and all possibilities considered, however, they have no problem adjusting to changing circumstances. This makes a 9 very capable as a long-term planner or advisor. Sun Number 9s are good at running an institution or team, yet they are not naturally good at the nitty gritty details of business finances and taxes.
		- A Sun Number 9 does best when they are involved with a venture they consider bigger than themselves. Itâ€™s important to a 9 to feel they have made their life count, and it sometimes can result in a slightly arrogant, self-righteous or the holier-than-thou syndrome.
		- Successful Sun Number 9s will learn to accept people for who they are, not expect them to change according to their expectations. People tend to either love a 9 or loathe a 9 ... there are few in between.
		- When it comes to love, the 9 Sun Number is perhaps the most difficult Sun Number to get close to. The 9 can seem distant, not often one to display emotion. In order to get involved in a romantic relationship, it is usually the 9 who has to reach out, as others tend to be both intimidated and unsure.

If your inspiration is very developed, you will be gifted with quite particular qualities which allow you to succeed in the areas that you are passionate about. You are quite demanding in your friendships. Naturally you are idealistic and likeable, this explaining why you don't like to get too involved in the material and accounting aspects of life. Possible faults : nervousness, emotional unbalance, a tendency to scorn people who are less intelligent than yourself, a fluctuating morality.

		- #12

Intelligent and brilliant, your imagination is fertile and creative, and you have an original approach to things. You have a natural enthusiasm and joy for living. You explore all the routes of communication and your social sense pushes you to multiply your links with others (which sometimes means additional responsibilities and a few narrow situations). Endowed with a great vitality and often impatient, you need activity as well as varied and creative interests. Sentimentally, you are rather conservative, faithful and loyal. You are tender, sensitive and in love with an ideal. Lived negatively, this number can lead you to get involved in too many activities, to lack stability and consistence, and become too extroverted or critical.

		- #13
		  You were born a 13. The vibration of this day brings balance, solidity, stability, the taste for effort at work, but also a certain stubbornness due to the blinkers of this number. You have a strong vitality and an ambition which paradoxically, unites creative or innovative conceptions with the latent need for traditionalism, stability and security. This ambiguous situation can sometimes mean that you find it difficult to accept all that limits or checks your desire to advance. So you live a period of inner crisis and you could be tempted to make a clean sweep and start everything again. Your aptitude for organization and performing tasks is sure. You are serious, sincere, responsible, persevering and determined. We can count on you. You are very attached to your home and it's inner frame. Decoration and interior work could become your profession, or at least your passion. Your strict and demanding character (with yourself as well as others) is susceptible to make you misunderstood and not liked very much. Lived negatively, this number can lead to different things : crises of authority, narrow-mindedness, parsimony, miserliness, frustration when faced with limitations and obstacles, driving you in a sort of infernal circle with alternative periods of letting go and then effort to make up for lost time.
		- Famous people born on a day 13 : Margaret Thatcher, Fidel Castro.
		- #14
		  You were born a 14. This is the number of the search for freedom, independence and new experiences or sensations. The vibration of this day bestows a natural extroversion, adaptability, sociability and charm on you. In love with freedom, you like change, disorientation, adventure and all that moves and evolves. This number is the one of magnetism and seduction, and the impression of flightiness and vivacity that you emit contributes to your charm. Your character is quite difficult to know : you are rather eclectic, your temperament is quite individualistic sometimes spectacular (risks don't frighten you and you have a certain luck) but you also have a serious side to your character (methodical and realistic). Fluctuating between the objective and subjective world, you have intuitive capacities and sometimes those of a medium. In fact, you are very creative, but you need a free and dynamic lifestyle to bloom. This could attract the wrath of society to you or that of those around you according to their tolerance level and understanding. Be careful that the resulting pressure doesn't push you to unconsciously smother your desire for innovation and freedom, due to a concern to be "normal". Preserve your free will ! For you, sentimental life isn't always absolutely reliable and it is in your interest to gain stability and maturity before you get involved. Lived negatively, this vibration of birth can lead you to excesses such as dispersion, the taste for provocation and risk, impatience, scattering, the abuse of sensory pleasures and the rejection of constraints.

You attract sympathy and respect. In general, you make a good partner and mother or father. You are quite a perfectionist, elitist and particularly sensitive to the aesthetic. Your home is welcoming and well decorated. This concern for beauty and love for beautiful forms will make you a magnetic person, but also susceptible to fall in love with anyone matching up to your aesthetic criterion. However, you have a double character and apart from your benevolent side looking for balance in everything, have a very prominent sense of independence and a strange ability to manipulate or influence others.

In general, events will have a tendency to come to you without having to provoke them, because you know how to attract them.

Material satisfactions and social position don't leave you indifferent. You could pass through phases of extravagance, generosity followed by financial rigour. You are charming, warm, optimistic and quite sensitive. Your courage and your enterprising mind push you to take on all sorts of challenges.

	- ## Life Path
	  collapsed:: true
		- Life Path is the reduction of the full date of birth.
		- The numerological reduction is made only when the sum is obtained in order to have the right secondary number.
		- Birth on December 14th 1982
		  12 + 14 + 1982 = 2008 = 10 = 1
		- The wrong calculation would be :
		  1 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 9 + 8 + 2 = 28 = 10 = 1
		  The right secondary number is 10 (not 28).
		- Your Life Path which is the reduced sum of your date of birth, gives an important indication on the type of events that you will be regularly confronted with, throughout your life. It isn't possible to skip school, the events always catch up with you, that's why in general one naturally adopts a style compatible with one's Life Path rather than going against the current. Numerology allows you to understand the nature of your route and the events likely to stimulate you. This will allow you the power to adopt the attitude that permits you to sail serenely on the sea of your life without capsizing or getting shaken about. As the old proverb says, "a well informed man is worth two".
		- Note : The Life Path does not necessarily indicate the way in which you react when faced with the different situations in your life. In effect, your reaction is mostly based on your assets that are your Intimate number, Expression number and Desire number. The style that one can detect across the Life Path (and possibly your Destiny Number) defines rather your overall behavior on the route that waits for you than your daily attitude (the character defined by your full name).
		  Understanding your Life Path
		- #1
		- You have a Life Path Number 1.
		  The route of conquerors, individuals and eccentrics.
		- It corresponds to the itinerary of those who are made for action and whose most important accomplishments are individual and original. In your life, it will be necessary for you to have courage, confidence in yourself, authority, a mind for independence or undertakings and a lot of determination. You will regularly be confronted with situations or obstacles that give you the opportunity to use and master this type of power ; the aim being to learn to reach success counting essentially on yourself. It is a destiny generally quite lucky. It incites worthiness, merit, conquering, innovating but also the acceptance of the consequences of your own decisions. With this Life Path you generally advance quickly and it is better no to try to force things too often because you may lose your pace or rhythm. A life rich in new developments during which you will be brought to develop self-assertion, a certain boldness and sometimes pride or a rebellious spirit. Perhaps it will help you to motivate others and draw them into your ways. You must take your destiny in hand, open the track and persevere !
		- Famous people with a Life Path 1 : Yves Saint-Laurent, Alain Prost, Sean Connery, Tom Cruise, Walt Disney, Charlie Chaplin, Henri Ford, Jacques-Yves Cousteau, Napoleon Bonaparte.
		- #2
		- You have a Life Path Number 2.
		  The route of companions, diplomats, right arm men or women.
		- The program of life that you have chosen by your birth favors everything to do with co-operation, communication, associations, friendships or marriage. It can be a harmonious life with tenderness but also with hesitation and duality. There are cross-roads all along this route and you will have to prove that you know how to live or work within a group (even limited to two), that you are able to co-operate and watch for the small details. This could be a paradoxical path. It is possible that you only benefit indirectly from successes to which you have contributed and you will often have to see the difference between appearance and reality. So intuition will be necessary ! On your journey, human contacts will play a primordial role (conciliation, advice or partner research). The need for a secure marriage will be strong. The Life Path 2 symbolizes a certain passivity when faced with events, a tendency to suffer them rather than to generate or master them. The advantage is that you will have the possibility to let the events or a valuable partner drive you along peacefully without too many problems. But prudence, not weakness ! Other outstanding events that you will be confronted with will touch your inner world (sensitivity, imagination, happiness, helpfulness, timidity, emotions, susceptibility). The lesson to be learnt from this itinerary is to actively collaborate (keeping in mind the excellent idea of "everybody winning"), without becoming too submissive, inert, indecisive or excessively emotional.
		- Famous people with a Life Path 2 : King Baudoin the first, Charles Prince of Wales, Claude Monet (one of the Impressionist).
		- #3
		- You have a Life Path Number 3.
		  The route of creative, happy and rather extrovert persons.
		- By your date of birth, you have chosen to know the route of the experience of the joy to live, the blooming of your faculties of expression and personal creativity. The most outstanding events for you will concern creations, art, verbal or written communication, sales, the media, the people you meet, friendships, beauty, leisure activities, sport and generally the social and love life. On this number 3 path, the human being has been called to express [his,her] freshness, creativity, interior riches, capacity to communicate, but if possible without diverting from authenticity or overstepping the mark. It is highly advisable not to take too seriously the hypocritical games or roles linked to social events. Keep your good sense, your naturalness. A destiny generally under the sign of luck, intelligence, contacts and sometimes talent. This itinerary offers you the opportunity to succeed quickly and even brilliantly if you avoid spreading yourself too thinly and giving in to the easy route. Above all, it is essential not to imagine that your life is a comfortable organized voyage, requiring no special effort on your part. You could well be confronted with difficulties testing your spontaneity, your creativity and your capacity to express yourself or to create a good mood. If you win this battle, your life will be original, illuminating and agreeable.
		- Famous people with a Life Path 3 : Yannick Noah, Victor Hugo, Richard Anderson (Mac Gyver the actor), John Wayne, Madonna, David Bowie, Enrico Caruso and Maria Callas (the most famous opera singer), Alfred Hitchcock (his inclination for thriller in his creativity came from his Day of Birth vibration, 13).
		- #4
		- You have a Life Path number 4.
		  The route of reliable and persistent working people.
		- You have come to this life to experiment with the concepts of security, stability and success through work and merit. You will be brought to prove discipline, method and regularity all the way along this route. A life of construction and seriousness as well as that which concerns your dwelling, your profession and yourself. You will be regularly confronted with situations calling on stability and solid aptitudes which push you to develop these powers. A relatively slow progression where only perseverance and merit will be rewarded. It is probable that your life will be regular, sometimes a bit routine or dull. An existence marked with projects to make real and stable. The lesson of this life program is to learn to carry out your work with regularity and to assume responsibility but without closing yourself to the rest of the world. In a word, to become a solid value. However, it will be more necessary to count on your force of personal achievement than on a possible easy success, by some donation or other.
		- Famous people with a Life Path 4 : Arnold Schwarzenegger, Clint Eastwood.
		- #5
		- You have a Life Path 5.
		  The route of adventurers, the bold and versatile.
		- You have come to this life to find adventure at all levels, see changes, travel and to experience all that life offers. A dynamic path but not always easy. It is the destiny of those who will have to defend their personal freedom, thanks to their quickness and talent. The individual on this path must learn how to free [himself,herself], to work without constraints, to become detached from the past and the future in order to grow in the present. All along this fortifying route you will have to prove that you know how to be versatile. A lot of opportunities to learn to adapt and to become enriched from different experiences. Curiosity and vivacity of mind will be welcome. Organized and routine structures won't suit you. You will be more at ease with new activities where all continually evolves (computer science, publicity, communication, sales, languages, travelling, leisure's and sports). In order not to veer off the good course of this path 5, you must be capable of distinguishing between the useful and unuseful. It will be necessary to cultivate a certain moderation, above all in physical areas (sensory or sexual over-indulgence, desire to live 110%) ; this is to reduce the probability of excess linked to your boldness. You are on a passionate path that leaves little time for idleness and boredom. It can lead to good fortune and success but also failure depending on how one uses it. The lesson of this path consists in accepting changes in a positive manner, to use them to enrich yourself but without leaving them to pull you down certain dangerous slopes (such as taking unconsidered risks, superficiality, being led astray, not much respect for others freedom).
		- At the extreme this vibration can push ventures and experiences to the excess. Either you search constantly your good fortune somewhere else, or you go too far in giving in to temptation or searching for wild pleasures (5 senses). And so you may finish by making a booby-trap for yourself due to your temperamental behavior. Don't lose your free-will. The idea is to keep a certain clear-headedness in order to put an end to all experiences that begin to imprison you rather than enriching you. It is important for your balance and your evolution.
		- Famous people with a Life Path 5 : Onassis, Pierre Cardin, Claudia Schiffer.
		- #6
		- You have a Life Path 6.
		  The route of responsibilities, conciliation, helpfulness and often of the aesthetics.
		- Prepare yourself for a vast program of responsibilities in all areas. A strong destiny for your free-will with a lot of choices to make, if possible in a positive and ambitious way rather than with hesitation or discord. A destiny which can correspond to a rapid ascension towards an important position (with numerous responsibilities) in the social, financial, political or media areas. More commonly a principal family role. The master of the house (host, hostess) who harmonizes, decides and reconciles. A flexible path of interpersonal harmonization where it will be necessary to chose well your principal orientations of life and relational environment. The others important points of reference for this path will be the taste for beautiful things, love and a sense of helpfulness. You will live situations where marriage, the family and listening will play a big role. You will be brought to judge, to balance and to help. The number 6 path can also symbolize responsibilities seen as burdens or trials, an excessive perfectionism, a tendency to interfere in other peoples affairs. The lesson being to assume responsibility but not to overload yourself with them. Don't be too demanding with others, prove that you are harmonious enough to live a positive number 6 path.
		- Famous people with a Life Path 6 : Albert Einstein, Agatha Christie, Laura Ashley, Nina Ricci, Albert Schweitzer (famous doctor in Africa), Charles De Gaulle, BjÃ¶rn Borg.
		- #7
		- You have a Life Path 7.
		  The route of thinkers and independent people.
		- It corresponds to an internally rich life, nearly solitary. This path will be the place to work with the mind and to have a certain taste for perfection. On this path, whatever your profession or education level, you will be pushed to reach a better understanding of yourself (introspection, ability to change your mind or call things into question, sometimes black thoughts) and the world around you. The outstanding events of this path will have more echo in your inner life (or will happen mostly in your own mind). Your itinerary will be symbolized by the taste for independence and sometimes solitude despite appearances ! It is often characterized by an original destiny with relatively easy success (things come to you) and a little bit disinterested with down-to-earth aspects. Friendships will have a great source of satisfaction, but marriage is not always easy especially if you are introverted.
		- You will regularly be confronted by events that will push you to question yourself, to look at your values. The duality and appearances will mark the situations of your life justly for you to develop your power of judgment and your perspicacity. You will be pushed to penetrate the heart of events to understand them better and master them little by little. These can be positive events (great success, luck) or negative (loss of a dear friend, a series of love breakdowns, injustices, the collapse of an ideal). These situations will sometimes be arduous, there will be periods of doubt and hope which incite you to turn inwards or sometimes to rebel against society. But don't cut yourself off from the outside world. On the contrary, use your intelligence and your knowledge to succeed in the outside world. Cultivate balance. Level-headedness, the interest for those around you, a certain form of detachment and interior calm will be useful on this path.
		- Famous people with a Life Path 7 : Marilyn Monroe, Lady Diana, Roger Moore, Gerard Depardieu, Paul Newman, John F. Kennedy, Herbert Von Karajan, Marcel Proust (famous French writer).
		- #8
		- You have a Life Path 8.
		  The route for the bold and materialists.
		- You have come to this life to deal with the notions of power, social recognition, material and financial achievement. The Life Path 8 does not say whether you will have or have not got power. It simply indicates that these notions will mark your life a lot, actively or reactively. You will be confronted by authority, financial gains, important material accomplishments, brilliant successes but probably also losses, bad failures and even accidents. In short, all that have a certain caliber in good as in bad. It is, therefore, a powerful but unstable path. You will have quite a few things to master in your life. Back away if necessary, but don't give up ! Welcome qualities : a lot of attention, a particular sense of balance, good judgment and vigor. It is often by this path that great successes happen (but also financial failures). Your life is placed under this vibration, it is necessary for you to understand and make the most of it, to develop your fighting spirit and your mastery. Your personal balance and your capacity to stay centered (to occupy the field) without going to extremes, will be your major assets. Please note that you can use this potential power fully or choose not to. In this case, you risk being regularly confronted by situations where you have to face attempt of reduction or dispossession of your power.
		- Learn to use the creative energy of this path to drive things forward, to take initiatives and succeed. Work with ambition, become an example of material success, learn to handle power, authority and money (as useful tool). You must find a balance quickly between the material and the spiritual so that the power or money does not blind you or make you disrespectful to the essential values of life. Always remember that you gather what you have sown. Don't be miserly, rigid or narrow-minded. Be ready to take up challenges, to overcome obstacles and to pick yourself up after defeats. Above all don't give up ! Efficiency, organization, self-confidence, generosity and also fluidity and sense of rhythm are the qualities that you must develop. It is a risky path, that let's nothing pass, especially if you are too sure of yourself or you want to climb too quickly. It is for you to choose to which degree you will use this strong vibration.
		- Famous people with a Life Path 8 : Carl Benz (Mercedes Benz), Ferdinand De Lesseps (channel of Suez), Winston Churchill, Jane Fonda, FranÃ§ois Mitterrand.
		- #9
		- You have a Life Path 9.
		  The route of idealists.
		- You have chosen to know the experience of the ideal, the noble causes, of the sensitivity and the great horizons. It is a path which favors travels, external and internal. This route will offer you a lot of experiences, instructive meetings and the possibility to cultivate your talent but also a particular sensitivity often turn towards altruism. The figure 9 symbolizes the end of a cycle and the beginning of the following one that will be lived with a higher level of consciousness. If you are able to free yourself from the hold of material contingencies of your life, you can establish these ideas and realize your vocation. This path can drive you towards greater horizons, familiarize you with more vast perspectives across culture, ecology, research, teaching, travelling, meeting people, altruism, humanism, sometimes with a large public. It is also an itinerary of emotions, internal travels, knowledge, unselfish action, avant-garde ideas which will imply your sensitivity, subtlety and open-mindedness. You will have to face some passionate events with profound repercussions (for you). Overall, a path of success and protection, favorable to travellers and altruistic, tolerant people as well as all those who will have known how to turn their sensitivity into a talent. But be careful not to get lost in impulses or passions that overtake you. It will be important to develop a certain prudence. In some cases take a back seat so as not to be dragged along toward ambiguous objective or into a tendency for illusions and sadness. Keep your spirits high, while holding on firmly to the helm of your life. Learn to open yourself to the world but without forgetting, neglecting yourself or you will risk disappointments and even losses. This until you understand that it is a matter of a bad approach on your part because your base support must be found within yourself and not outside.
		- Famous people with a Life Path 9 : Charles Lindberg (first Atlantic crossing by plane), Baden Powell, M. Gandhi, La Fayette, Edmund Hillary (first on Mt. Everest), Jean-jacques Rousseau (famous social writer), Elvis Presley, Brigitte Bardot.
		- #11
		- You have a Life Path 11.
		  The route of intuitive people, visionaries and self-taught persons.
		- It symbolizes a life of inspiration and/or mastery. This itinerary favors success, ambitious and original accomplishments. It can put you on a social, cultural, political or religious route, or into the role of a leader. More modestly, this path can be link with the ability to teach, an attraction for communication or persuasion. You will be confronted by events that will encourage listening, psychology, intuition and some of your inner richness. However, it is necessary not to search for material success by egoism or pride ; this would only bring difficulties. The number 11 vibration is synonymous with inspiration, panache, knowledge, intelligence but also psychological ascendancy and creativity. These are the qualities that must motivate you. If you are capable of altruism and good sense, this path can only be positive.
		- It will be necessary for you to develop well your ability for inspiration, inner listening (but without making hasty conclusions) and to cultivate a strong personality, capable of patience as well as rapid decision making. This balance will be indispensable for you and faced with others in order not to fall into the classical excess of this path : superiority complex, desire to dominate, intolerance, incoherence and disinterest in domestic obligations. Use the great energy of this vibration to advance in the right direction, to take on big responsibilities, to share your thoughts, knowledge and intuitions with others. Magnetism and sense of contact will be your assets on this route.
		- Famous people with a Life Path 11 : Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Coco Chanel, Benito Mussolini (here lived on the negative way).
		- If a Life Path 11 is too strong for you, you will live it in level 2 :
		  The route for the companion, the diplomat, the right arm men or women.
		- The fundamental difference with the Life Path 11 is situated in the capacity to run your life, take important decisions and to put your inspirations and intuitions into practice. There will be more passivity with the number 2 vibration.
		- The program of life that you have chosen by your birth favors everything to do with co-operation, communication, associations, friendships or marriage. It can be a harmonious life with tenderness but also with hesitation and duality. There are cross-roads all along this route and you will have to prove that you know how to live or work within a group (even limited to two), that you are able to co-operate and watch for the small details. This could be a paradoxical path. It is possible that you only benefit indirectly from successes to which you have contributed and you will often have to see the difference between appearance and reality. So intuition will be necessary ! On your journey, human contacts will play a primordial role (conciliation, advice or partner research). The need for a secure marriage will be strong. The Life Path 2 symbolizes a certain passivity when faced with events, a tendency to suffer them rather than to generate or master them. The advantage is that you will have the possibility to let the events or a valuable partner drive you along peacefully without too many problems. But prudence, not weakness ! Other outstanding events that you will be confronted with will touch your inner world (sensitivity, imagination, happiness, helpfulness, timidity, emotions, susceptibility). The lesson to be learnt from this itinerary is to actively collaborate (keeping in mind the excellent idea of "everybody winning"), without becoming too submissive, inert, indecisive or excessively emotional.
		- Famous people with a Life Path 2 : King Baudoin the first, Charles Prince of Wales, Claude Monet (one of the Impressionist).
		- #22
		- You have a Life Path 22.
		  A route for great builders, organizers and creators.
		- You have chosen a life out of the ordinary. It is a path which favors concrete projects of caliber, the creations of genius, posts with very high responsibilities that interest a great number of people, even the world. An itinerary destined for those who are not afraid to see big and where in general there is only little time for a private life because of the overflowing activity that accompanies these ambitious achievements (in architecture, civil engineering, discoveries, constructions, creations, the arts, great writings, politics, international affairs). This Life Path symbolizes a great intelligence or creativity, the taste for challenges, a remarkable intuition and imagination with the ability to realize your aspirations. To live this exceptional path well, it will be necessary for you to refine these qualities and use them to build, construct and create if possible in seeing to the well-being of the community. With such a path you risk being a bit in advance of your time. It will be necessary for you to radiate and manage your talents in the optimal way to avoid certain traps like getting carried away with dreams of power, leaving yourself to be allured by the taste for power to the point that you lose all sense of reality. You could be called to handle a lot of money, to take decisions having a big impact ; this is why the qualities of wisdom, personal mastery, sincerity, flexibility and altruism will be welcome if you want to live harmoniously. You will certainly have need of a companion who can show intelligence, creativity of mind, imagination and in all cases availability and flexibility because it is probable that you will hate limited situations on the personal level as much as on the professional.
		- Famous people with a Life Path 22 : Leonard De Vinci, Margaret Thatcher, Paul Bocuse (the worldwide famous "chef franÃ§ais de haute cuisine"), Paul Mc Cartney.
		- It is however rare to live completely in such a vibration, that is why for the most part this path is lived on level 4 :
		  The route of the reliable and persistent working people.
		- You have come to this life to experiment with the concepts of security, stability and success through work and merit. You will be brought to prove discipline, method and regularity all the way along this route. A life of construction and seriousness as well as that which concerns your dwelling, your profession and yourself. You will be regularly confronted with situations calling on stability and solid aptitudes which push you to develop these powers. A relatively slow progression where only perseverance and merit will be rewarded. It is probable that your life will be regular, sometimes a bit routine or dull. An existence marked with projects to make real and stable. The lesson of this life program is to learn to carry out your work with regularity and to assume responsibility but without closing yourself to the rest of the world. In a word, to become a solid value. However, it will be more necessary to count on your force of personal achievement than on a possible easy success, by some donation or other.
		- Famous people with a Life Path 4 : Arnold Schwarzenegger, Clint Eastwood.
	- ## Cycles
	  collapsed:: true
		- In Numerology, life is divided into 3 Cycles: formative, productive, harvest.
		- Each corresponds to the vibration of a particular number and will give a general orientation of a rather psychological nature during the period where it takes place. A Cycle tells us about our tastes, our priorities or centers of interest. As it were for the orientation of our personality and projects during this period. These tastes of course change with the appearance of a new life Cycle.
		- Each of these three Cycles corresponds approximately to 356 lunar months, in other words 28 years and 4 months. The third Cycle or harvest Cycle will last until the end of your lifetime. The passage from one Cycle to the next happens progressively.
		- A certain acclimatization is necessary. This period of acclimatization is not as clear. One could say that Cycle isn't really in place until the beginning of the Personal Year Number 1 which is the closest to the start of a Cycle.
		- Cycle 1 (formative) : reduced number of the month of birth
		  Cycle 2 (productive) : reduced number of the day of birth
		  Cycle 3 (harvest) : reduced number of the year of birth
		  So how do you calculate your Numerology Cycle number?
		  Simple - the three Cycle numbers are found in the numbers of your month, day, and year of birth. Reduce your day and month of birth, then add them together. Reduce that number to a single digit, then add it to your year of birth, and reduce that total to a single number. Done !
		- Below find an overview of what each cycle means to your life. If you need a more in-depth analysis, please visit our Detailed Interpretation by Cycle Number page, or see the overview below:
		- How each Cycle Influences your Life?
		- #1
		  The number 1 cycle is going to influence the individual in such a way that [he,she] will place the most importance on ambition, energy, ventures, innovation, self-assertion even authority and the desire to dominate.
		- #2
		  The person in cycle 2 is going to privilege alliances (in work, friendships or marriage), emotions, kindness, sensitivity, creativity and the concern for detail. On the other hand, at the time of such a cycle the receptivity risks taking the place of initiative and combativeness. From where possible difficulties of agreement can take place with someone living in a number 9 cycle and sometimes 1 and 8.
		- #3
		  In cycle 3, one privileges communication, sociability, the joy of living, expression (oral, written, corporeal or artistic) and of course creativity. At the time of such a cycle one risks lacking in discipline, dissipating one's efforts, being a bit too carefree, from where a possible disagreement with the people in cycle 7 or 4 can take place.
		- #4
		  In cycle 4, one has a point of view privileging the " ant's " way of life. In other words : work, saving,. effort, construction and prudence. By way of consequence one will relegate leisure, amusement, and all types of adventures to second place, from where a possible strategic disagreement can arise with people in opposing or distant cycles (in particular 3, 5 or 9).
		- #5
		  In cycle 5, one opts for freedom, discoveries. One appreciates activities, move, variety, adventures including emotional ones and versatility. Possible stirs with someone living in a cycle 4, 6 or 9.
		- #6
		  A person in cycle 6 will be more sensitive to the aspect of responsibility, to familial and social harmony, aesthetic, love and security. A point of view not always compatible with someone living in a number 5 cycle (except perhaps concerning the sensual aspect).
		- #7
		  In cycle 7, one is above all attracted by reflection, understanding, observation, and calm. You will privilege intellectual friendships more than emotional, thus, love and marriage will have a little less importance during this period. Not always compatible with someone living in a number 3 cycle and privileging extroversion.
		- #8
		  The person in cycle 8 is going to see thing differently. All that has a trait to ambition, power, business, social and financial success as well as big projects will be privileged. A lot of energy and combativeness in this cycle, which leaves less space for purely emotional communication. You are quite hard to please !
		- #9
		  In cycle 9, there is an open-mindedness. The person is going to privilege the greatness of the soul, ideals, altruistic or universal views, culture, research etc. This must leave less time for yourself and your own life. Lived in a too idealistic fashion, this cycle risks being confronted with some problems of incompatibility with the cycles 2, 4, 5 and 8.
		- #11
		  In cycle 11, you privilege inspiration, intuition, the desire for perfection, individual ways, spiritual evolution and leadership. So there will be an incompatibility of view point with someone in cycle 4. If this cycle 11 is lived as 2, which is quite frequent, the problem will no longer be posed because the person will privilege co-operation, the concern with detail and gentleness.
		- #22
		  A person in cycle 22 will have a wide vision and will be attracted by great achievements, ideas or inventions helping a lot of people. More often lived as a 4, this cycle is going to privilege you with options such as work, construction, the solid, prudence and saving. Your personal well-being will be in both cases a bit abandoned.

		- The 3 Cycles of your life
		- We consider that the Yang (masculine) vibration of this Cycle is more outstanding for an individual than that of the Pinnacle (Yin-feminine) which doesn't concern ideas or inclinations but the concrete aspects.
		- The formative Cycle (the 1st) corresponds to the reduced number of the month of birth, the 2nd Cycle called productive, corresponds to the reduced number of the day of birth, the harvest Cycle (3rd), corresponds to the reduced number of the year of birth.
		- #1/1
		  You are in formative Cycle 1. This vibration is powerful and allows the quick development of your personal abilities. It will help you to structure your personality in a harmonious way. If you don't come across any major obstacles you will quickly learn to assert yourself, to be individual (in the family environment and then the social), in all cases you will be attracted by these notions or all activities demanding ambition, rather original ideas and willpower. Success is frequent in such a Cycle. During this period, your desire and enthusiasm must not be hindered. Your personality is in effect, still fragile. All who help you to become conscious of your personal assets, all who encourage you to express yourself with originality and creativity will be welcome. It is judicious to make sure that those around you don't behave in a tyrannical manner or try to suppress your initiatives. The number 1 vibration doesn't allow itself to be subdued and it would only provoke a rebellion on your part.
		- It is preferable to encourage yourself in the way of independence, self-confidence in helping yourself to keep a good rhythm and not to fall into the excesses which are pride, harshness, impatience or egoism. When you understand that you can be strong, autonomous and nevertheless deal with others in a friendly and useful way, the balance is reached.
		- #1/2
		  You are in productive Cycle 1. This period is placed under the impulsion of a type 1 force that makes you privilege the concepts of ambition, originality and enthusiasm. You will have the desire to organize yourself and to manage alone. Success in perspective. Your considerable personal energy will push you to opt for original activities and to bloom in an independent way. You know where you want to go. To be sexually dominant or aggressive will please you. The areas necessitating daring, an aptitude for commandment, qualities of autonomy and new ideas will attract you. You will have the desire to shine. Don't worry, this Cycle will offer you sufficient opportunities to prove your personal abilities, to achieve your ambitions or to start from new bases. Possible excesses : sacrifice of those around you or family life to your desires of conquest, possible intolerance or impulsiveness. On the contrary, it sometimes happens a fear of taking things in hand if you have a hang-up due to your education. Know how to keep your balance and a minimum of the sense of co-operation and respect of others in your coming course.
		- #1/3
		  You are in a harvest Cycle 1. This period is going to benefit from the energy of this number 1 vibration : ambition, originality, innovation and a taste for commandment. Sometimes impulsiveness also. You will have the desire to put yourself forward and grant more importance to your independence. It's important to you to keep pursuing your activities (mental and material) and even undertake new things or put your ideas into practice. A creative enthusiasm animates you and it is probable (if this wasn't yet the case) that your behavior will be more assertive and independent. Have the courage to change a little and apply your new options (without feeling guilty), but avoid going to the opposite excess in not keeping a certain sense of conciliation and hospitality (such a behavior could lead you to loneliness).
		- #2/1
		  You are in formative Cycle 2. This cycle is going to be under a rather feminine influence, shown by a youthfulness very marked by the protective presence of the mother (unless it is the grandmother or a big sister), probably alone in the home or assuming parental responsibilities because of the estrangement of the father. This allows us to foresee a period where one privileges friendships, tenderness, sensitivity, imagination and even dreaming. This influence presents a lot of advantages (fine qualities, kindness, intuition...) and brings an interesting point of view. However, it must not be excessive or it will lead towards a sort of emotional dependence as well as a sickly indecision at the beginning of life. It is advised to do everything so that this youthfulness can also have a place outside of the maternal protection in order that you can learn to assert yourself elsewhere, all benefiting from this feminine support. All that can help you to develop your power of decision, your autonomous ability and to manage your emotions healthily (to dominate the tendency for submission or an excessive sensitivity) will be profitable to your growth. The people close to you must give you the love that you need but without being too indulgent or resigning because this won't help you. You may be tempted to marry very young, before you have sufficiently grown, perhaps more due to the need to cling to someone or to find more quickly this protective atmosphere again, than the wish to live as a couple.
		- #2/2
		  You are in productive Cycle 2. A period where one privileges marriage, the home, friendships, diplomacy, associations and co-operation. During this Cycle, you will not be especially pushed to put yourself forward or to take quick decisions, but you will be very much at ease at work or in activities necessitating the talents of co-operation (tact, flexibility, imagination, creativity, a sense of detail...) or aid (medical, secretarial...). You will have the desire to communicate, to express your feelings or to become involved in a group. Others count a lot to your eyes in this Cycle orientated towards the union. It is a favorable period to the emotions and to all that they can favor : inspiration, subtlety, human warmth, gentleness, friendship, helpfulness but also emotional fragility, apathy, anxiety. Whatever happens you will go with it (you are ready to arrange everything, to follow the events and you easily accept strokes of fate). Your progress will seem slow, sometimes irregular and in all cases dependent on surroundings and circumstances. You like to give, you know how to receive. Sexually you prefer to opt for gentleness. The sense of sharing and welcoming will be important to you during this Cycle. Be careful of the drifting which consists in clinging a bit too firmly onto others or their ideas, to the point of becoming " sticky " because it will end up by you being rejected or exploited. If on the other hand, the rest of your analysis indicates strong characteristics of independence, this period may be more difficult for you ; it will require effort in the area of co-operation and conciliation (for the good progression of the Cycle). Reassure yourself that one can collaborate very well without losing one's individuality !
		- #2/3
		  You are in harvest Cycle 2. An apparently peaceful period where you will privilege gentleness, tenderness, co-operation and helpfulness. Make the most of this peaceful retreat ! Not many new initiatives. Your relationship activities and the practice of your hobbies will occupy your days. A need of material security as well as emotional security. Desire to give pleasure to others. If you know how to make do with this new tranquil period and prove your kindness and flexibility concerning those around you, you will be repaid. A possible enlarged feminine influence for a man under this vibration.
		- #3/1
		  You are in formative Cycle 3. It is a pleasant period, happy and warm, very rich in friendships, in going out and in games. You will have the desire to express yourself more, to communicate and develop your artistic or creative predispositions. Charm will have your favor. What more can one ask to start life ! Your energy and your talents in one or more of the following areas : writing, the arts, communication, creation in a wide sense will allow you to express your originality and make yourself known, particularly around the age of 21 (the peak of this pleasant Cycle). In this rapid and fascinating evolution, those around you have every interest to support you in your cultural needs, your search for contact, your desire for leisure and sport, your considerable need for emotional and affective stability ; but also to guide you in your choices in order to avoid doing too many things at once, inachievement or superficiality that would lead you to instability. There is also a tendency to be gossipy and sometimes to want to be the center of attention.
		- #3/2
		  You are in productive Cycle 3. You are favored because this is probably the most agreeable Cycle of the lot. Growth and blossoming in perspective. Make the most of it, and share it with others. It is a fascinating period that awaits you with a great big sun shining on your emotional and affective landscape. Years full of creativity, success, friendships and carefreeness. Interest in the areas of creativity, the media and marketing. You will have a stronger desire to communicate, to charm, to entertain and above all to please and amuse yourself. Probably some travelling for pleasure. You will also have sense of audience and you will be appreciated, without a doubt. The passage of this Cycle is excellent for your personal expression in all it's forms. You will give more importance to beauty. You will certainly have the desire to break new ground with flirtation and sensuality. The area of social relationships will be one of your priorities. However, don't become intoxicated by all the opportunities that luck brings you. They won't always be available in your life. This is why it is in your interest to manage your time well, your money and relationships in order to construct a harmonious and solid world around yourself. On the other hand, don't be afraid to express yourself, to highlight your personal possibilities (especially if the rest of your analysis is rich in vibrations like 4 or 7). Break free from the crowd and don't let the obstacles break your spirit.
		- #3/3
		  You are in harvest Cycle 3. An agreeable, serene period, enriched with human contacts comes your way. Your areas of interest are : cheerfulness, enriching relationships, pleasant activities and the diverse forms of expression or creativity. Probably some travelling for pleasure and perhaps a late love... Make the most of things, otherwise you would be wrong. Communicate with those around you, grow but don't burn up all your reserves of energy in one blow.
		- #4/1
		  You are in formative Cycle 4. At the start of life a few hard times await you. There will be some difficulties in moving forward easily (perhaps at school, during your studies, your entrance into working life or in your marriage). You may be confronted quite early with the notions of effort, discipline or obligations because of family difficulties or to develop a talent (artistic or sportive). But the notions of application, patience and method don't necessarily impose themselves on you ; it also comes about that one pushes to prove an attraction for seriousness very early. Due to discipline, work and austerity, there isn't, a priori, the carefreeness and amusement that is usual for youth (or the idea that one can have about childhood). However, all these efforts will be recompensed by the putting in place of a solid personal structure, giving a certain advantage for the future.
		- Advice to parents :
		  Lighten the burden that your child can feel. Give [him,her] some possibilities of opening and personal expression. Sport will allow [him,her] to let off steam and externalize. Help [him,her] to be confident, for example in encouraging [his,her] work, in enhancing [him,her] in a subtle way. Try to give [him,her] a sense of sure and stable values : discipline, organization, courage, quality of work. But in offering these values, in drawing [his,her] interest onto these values ; never force [him,her] (counter-productive). The child needs a stable environment to link [himself,herself] with. It sometimes happens that family problems perturb the young persons spirit and block [his,her] progression at school (with orientation towards a short cycle). The relationship with the father is often delicate in a Cycle 4 and it will be better if he is not too managing and repressive.
		- #4/2
		  You are in productive Cycle 4. This is a period where you want to be productive and make solid constructions. You will be attracted by work and security, stability and the valorization that it procures. In your eyes, life will be something serious and constructive. Details, discipline, honesty, loyalty and discretion are some of your privileged themes. Little time and little money will be allotted to leisure (except do-it-yourself) or parties. Everything must be useful, well managed and accounted for !
		- If you like this sort of thing, this Cycle is made for you ! Use your energy and good practical sense which will easily be at your disposition during this phase to structure your life well and prepare for the future. Don't count too much on luck. If necessary ask for help, because there are some obstacles which are sometimes difficult to clear alone. You will be more at ease in an activity which requires the acceptance of a certain routine and regularity (administration or technical professions for example). Your centers of interest lean towards manual work, construction, the resolution of practical problems and down to earth things. You will be motivated by organization, discipline, the practical and traditional subjects. Sexually, you will want to be conventional. Generally not a lot of travelling (except in the professional area). In a general way, this period will allow you to develop and enhance yourself by your accomplishments, your seriousness.
		- Try to make the most of this central part of your life. Give yourself the possibility to get out of the rigid areas and change the atmosphere sometimes. Schedule some moments of relaxation, don't put too much austerity or monotony in your emotional and sensual relationships. Don't forget that these areas are necessary in a balanced life. Otherwise you can expect a troubled health (especially between the ages of 44 and 48) or unpleasant surprises within your couple.
		- #4/3
		  You are in harvest Cycle 4. A rather laborious retirement benefiting from the energy of this number. A rather sedentary mode of life and an interest for serious, concrete and traditional subjects. You can finish the intricate details of decoration in your house, occupy yourself with everyday trials, with your savings or strengthen your " securing structure ". It will be necessary to avoid withdrawing into yourself and imposing rigid limits on yourself (or on others !).

		  You are in formative Cycle 5. A rich start to life where variety, the need for change, carefreeness, pleasures, the apprenticeship of life and the need for freedom dominate. You will have the desire to discover and to move while following your pleasures a little. Whatever your level, it will not always help you in the school and university system... A very mobile period where by curiosity and taste for games you look for adventure, action, sporting records, the exploration of new areas and the most diverse experiences. You will need a lot of space, openings, a great setting but also surroundings to avoid making thousand and one stupid mistakes in wanting to experiment with everything. You will prove your autonomy very early and your vitality will be great. You will evolve through the diversity, guided by your curiosity. You must learn to use your free-will intelligently. The experiences that you will choose to live (rather than suffering them) must enrich you and not alienate you ; that is why it would be welcome that those around you to are stable speakers and incite you to finish what you start and learn something. In a Cycle 5 there is a tendency to do too many things at once and not finish any of them. It is advised to your parents to give you a secure environment during your childhood, while being flexible and pleasant so that you can push to " experiment " without being left to yourself. You adore travelling during your youth. Your sensuality could develop earlier or it could be more marked. At school, you can be brilliant but your apparent ability and your sometimes not very disciplined airs lead to a strong risk that you will not have a good relationship with teachers or adults, who don't always appreciate that style of behavior. The lesson of this number consists in accepting the incitement to adventure, sport, experiences and changes, but also in understanding the finality which is the acquisition of a mastery of your free-will and your impulsiveness so allowing a healthy and balanced life. A happy medium must be found without abruptness otherwise this could destabilize you and cause you to lose momentarily your lucidity in full development.

		  You are in productive Cycle 5. A dynamic period where you will privilege freedom, the movements of life : numerous and varied activities, moves, travels, adventures, sport, new friendships, flirtations. It is your way to appreciate life. You have multiple interests and your hunger for new things will push you continuously towards different experiences. To enjoy this freedom, it is well worth not accepting important responsibilities which would hinder your incessant schemes (games, projects). The best thing for you professionally during this Cycle is to find a job that involves travelling, where you can see new things, where you can handle new concepts. Choose an activity which demands vivacity of mind and a great capacity for understanding or adaptation.
		- The emotional and sentimental life is going to take on a particular importance for you. This Cycle foresees new friendships and love adventures. Like a butterfly you could move from flower to flower with disconcerting ease. Try to find an enriching education in all that you live and be careful to preserve your free-will so that you can always choose to live the experiences that will benefit you and not be seduced or alienated by the first temptation that comes along. Also think about the good maintenance of your body in avoiding the abuses (your vitality is important and it will do better in being well-managed), in practicing regularly a sporting activity rather than alternating from over doing it to doing nothing at all. Adopt a very healthy diet.
		- #5/3
		  You are in harvest Cycle 5. Your centers of interest will be related to freedom, variety and vitality. Don't be surprised by this carefree but expansive period which opens itself to you. This period will be dotted with a lot of moves and changes. You don't grow weary from criss-crossing the country and discovering new things. Fortunately you are disposed with a new energetic spirit. Make the most of leisure that present themselves to you during this pleasant period still rich in possibilities of growth to satisfy your more pronounced taste (during this Cycle) concerning exploration and the experimentation of new ideas or activities. However, be careful that your more marked need for personal freedom doesn't push you towards egoism and a lack of respect for the freedom and needs of others. Show your flexibility.
		- #6/1
		  You are in formative Cycle 6. A start of life marked by the family and the harmony. Lived well, this number 6 vibration augurs an agreeable, pleasant and warm youth. You will privilege emotional and affective security, conciliation, activities in relation to the body, well-being, aesthetics and interior decoration. There will be a more rapid maturity of sensitivity, the sense of aesthetics, diplomacy and charm in your personality. You will want to be responsible, to appear mature and balanced. If this period is lived excessively, it is possible that you will be confronted very early and perhaps despite yourself with duties and obligations (in general imposed by your mother) which will be a bit out of proportion for your age. All these hard facts would not absolutely color your youth as your natural carefree behavior and rising individuality would urge you to. During this sometimes restrictive Cycle, it will probably be necessary for you to often help others and learn to create harmony and conciliation around you. These same vibrations can incite you to marry quite early or make you leave the family environment if it is too heavy to support. Besides, it would be better if your family avoided loading too much and too early your shoulders with strict principles and obligations. This would be unproductive. It is necessary to allow time for your psychology to reach maturity and favor the development of your aesthetic sensitivity (talent or probable artistic orientation) all this while leaving your rising sense of tenderness (fairness, kindness) to grow naturally.
		- The excesses to avoid in this Cycle are :
		  A tendency to take pleasure in a blurred personal talent allowing a running away from responsibilities felt as stifling (dream takes place over reality). In this case there will be later a risk of indecision, a need to cling psychologically to someone and this is not a good preparation for adult life !
		- The possibility of a certain reaction based on harshness (construction of a personal armor) faced with an environment which is too demanding, too serious, hampering the harmonious growth of your personality, notably on the level of human warmth and harmony.
		- #6/2
		  You are in productive Cycle 6. A period where the notions of responsibilities (family, professional, social), of conciliation and adaptation to the circumstances and the people will be privileged. The family, the home, the obligations (wanted or not) will take first place in your preoccupations. During this period, you will search for peace, harmony, comfort and human warmth (above all within your home). The aesthetic, artistic and sentimental aspects will occupy a more important place as well as all that relates to kindness. You will avoid confrontations and shouting. The softness of atmosphere, human warmth will be the increased values for you during this period. Often appealed to help and listen to others, you will have a lot of people around you. Sometimes, you will have the impression of being a bit of a " mug ". Your need for love and romance is very great but don't idealize the other beyond [his,her] worth. Sexually you will be very sensual, very tender. Your professional life is generally under a good star during this phase ! All that touches the dwelling place, decoration, aesthetics, well-being and hospitality (advise, public relations...) will be favored.
		- Some excesses are possible. A tendency to want to meddle with everything, to try to help everyone, which ends up by you being insupportable. Also be careful not to lose view of your options and personal desires by implicating yourself to much in family contingencies, all sorts of responsibilities, the desire to be nice to everyone and to always conciliate conflicting points of view. Keep your landmarks. Learn to make choices or to say " no " when your balance is at stake. Watch out for moral imprisonment and the exhaustion of your reserves of kindness.
		- #6/3
		  You are in harvest Cycle 6. You should benefit from a good period, by way of protection, harmony and affection. Security of course, but also a certain number of loads that it will be necessary for you to accept with understanding. During the course of this Cycle your centers of interest are going to be directed towards the aesthetic or the arts, body-care, well-being and all that is concerned with the home, comfort, property and decoration. On the psychological side your priorities will be searching for harmony (personal and in relationships), human warmth, love and sensitivity. You will be available for others, ready to help materially or morally. You will have the tendency to take on more responsibilities. Obligations will also come to you in this Cycle. Moderate this tendency if your shoulders become to heavy. This capacity to assume responsibilities and make harmony reign around you will sign the success of this Cycle. In return, you will receive respect and love. Your sensitivity, your possible artistic talents will always be appealed to during this important period and new creations will be able to come to light, bringing you satisfaction and sometimes fame.
		- #7/1
		  You are in formative Cycle 7. Your behavior will be quite reserved and not always understood by others. Your calm and reflective attitude will push you to keep away from the noisy games of the children of your age and orientates you more towards your inner world. The activities of reflection will have your favors. Without a doubt this will awaken your intellectual or spiritual capacities more quickly. In this way, you will certainly turn quite early to adults. Your searches will be multiple and your sense of observation developed. Even if you express yourself in a discrete way (rather in writing), you will know very quickly what you want and your decisions won't be taken lightly (except if you lack good information...). You will need to make sure that you have moments of tranquility to enable you to function well. Your rich inner life and your strong sensitivity will push you to pose numerous questions, but also to isolate yourself a bit from the world, particularly if those around you seem to be hostile or torn. This is moreover, one of the possible diversions (coldness, melancholy, interior suffering). So, the child risks being withdrawn, out of touch or rebellious. Therefore, it will be necessary to favor the aspect of intellectual communication or the sharing of emotions. All that pushes towards expression, communication and bringing out the introversion (creations, going out, new things, sport) will be welcome.
		- Advice to parents :
		  Help your child to overcome the initial failures by explaining that a failure must be considered as a source of information and not as a dishonor. There is no reason at all for [him,her] to hold [himself,herself] in lower esteem or to lock [himself,herself] inside a " vicious circle ". To act in this way would mean an unhealthy emotional attitude and not intelligent behavior. It will be important to teach your child to set reachable goals for [himself,herself] and to get out of [his,her] little world. Possible inner suffering (hidden) ask to be taken into account. It will be necessary to prove your subtlety and understanding faced with your child's ambiguous emotional attitude (sentiments sometimes difficult to grasp). Encourage [him,her] to be more open, to express [his,her] feelings, to let [his,her] heart do the talking so that [he,she] can grow. That is why it is necessary to encourage your child to express [himself,herself] verbally and to prove [his,her] good sense. Make sure that you surround your child with affection. Be a pole of stability and brightness for [him,her].
		- #7/2
		  You are in productive Cycle 7. A tranquil period, often studious where the inner life will have a great importance. Your centers of interest will be in the direction of reflection, ideas, observation, meditation, possible studying, philosophical or scientific research, intellectual work, writing, computer science and sometimes the spiritual or religious world. A phase where progress is sometimes slow, independent and often solitary. You will advance regularly by proving your ability for analysis and observation. Your mind will always stay on the look out in it's hunger for knowledge and openings within numerous areas. It is a favorable Cycle for all intellectual activities, but also for originality and you will certainly be pushed to detach yourself from the masses. Don't be unduly surprised if your precursor attitude is badly understood by certain people.
		- Because of your intellectual options and your taste for introversion and reflection, the emotional and sentimental area will not be the place that you excel the most. Others will find it difficult to define you and due to this, the attempts of expression of your warm spirit (more irregular in this Cycle but still present) won't always be easy. Marriages are relatively rare in a number 7 cycle. Will be favored instead friendships or relationships (including marital) where intellectual communication is dominant. But keep confident. There is no fate. Don't force things. Don't look to create romantic meetings. Work a bit on your image, change your attitude, shine more, show your joy of living and let the positive occasions present themselves by themselves. Be a magnet, that's all. During this key period of your life, you have a path of wisdom, intuition and intellectual or spiritual progress. This signifies that black, hazy, fanatic or sterile ideas have no place here. Neither do inner tensions. On the contrary, develop your lucidity, your practical sense, your spontaneity and your well-being. Become an example of balance and self-confidence. Avoid getting involved in large financial investments before having reached this level. Otherwise you would certainly make some errors of calculation.
		- The lesson of this vibration : Wisdom means using practical applications of observation and semantic reflection, to find balance and clarity. It is not a matter of throwing yourself into the arms of the first appealing theory.
		- The possible excesses will be melancholy, sadness, excessive daydreaming, detachment from practical or warm activities, not enough sporting activities, illusions and obsessions. It's up to you to overcome these limitations.
		- #7/3
		  You are in harvest Cycle 7. It is a period of your life where your psychological options will incite you to stay away from the agitation of the world, in a tranquil area favorable for reflection, writing, observation or meditation. Your growing taste for analysis, your search for wisdom and your hunger for knowledge (reading, general culture, computer science or thematic discussions) will easily fill up your time. Travelling ? Why not, but for studies or improvement. It is a sort of studious retreat, probably active, where the intellectual or cultural ingredient will be dominant for you to succeed in your personal evolution, but also with your social relationships.
		- The possible problems that can arise are : a tendency for solitude because you could want to erect your ideas by dogmas and become a bit too intellectual, even egoistic and cold. If this is the case, climb a little, don't neglect others (helpfulness) and keep a sense of reality. This will favor your evolution and serenity. The lesson of this number 7 vibration : wisdom means learning to make practical applications of observation and semantic reflection, to find balance and clarity. Lived badly, this period can end up with melancholy, a latent sadness, an excess of daydreaming, a progressive detachment from practical or warm (affective) activities, a lack of physical activity and illusions. It's up to you to overcome these limitations.
		- #8/1
		  You are in formative Cycle 8. This Cycle is placed under a strong vibration. Great energy will be at your disposal. You will quickly have the taste for material achievements, as well as organization, challenges, combativeness but also power, money and sometimes justice. The people who start life under this Cycle will learn the sense of material and financial values more rapidly than others. A certain aggressiveness, ardor, recklessness and searching for confrontations will mark these years as necessary phases for the construction of your personality. Your achievements, more and more important will be detected by their quickness and efficiency. Social success will be within reach at the end of this Cycle. Watch out for the risk of getting carried away. Know how to keep your head. Never cry " victory " too soon. If the energy of this vibration imposes itself on you with too much force for your young shoulders, you may be confronted a little early with the notions of wealth (to much or not enough), power, combat or competition. It is possible on account of your other personal vibrations, that this type of competition arriving brutally disturbs or demotivates you. The number 8 energy is not suitable in effect, for those people who are not ready to use it. However, it is better not to reject the current completely or you risk to undergo it. Try to allow it to help you in progressing more rapidly.
		- To make the most of this vibration harmoniously, it is necessary to show your lucidity, your interest for the universal laws, generosity and spiritual balance. Otherwise you will be trapped by the mirage of materialism, power and social success. Be careful. The real battle demands, above all, finding a balance in yourself and lucidity. It is important to understand your qualities, your faults or for taking good decisions. Those who believe that winning consists in beating the adversary, belittling him or obtaining the result with any means possible still have a lot to learn.
		- Advice to parents :
		  Your child is disposed with a great dynamism. Thus, it is rather on the level of behavior and mastery of life that it is necessary to help. Sport and activities in fresh air can play the role of energy regulator in helping your child to exert [himself,herself] naturally. Rather than giving [him,her] too many facilities on the material level, it would be a better idea to teach [him,her] how to use money wisely, to reinforce [his,her] qualities of management and concrete construction, because it is in these areas that [he,she] will have to assert and develop [himself,herself]. Encourage your child to defend [his,her] interests, to express opinions, to clarify [his,her] options and to find [his, her] place in the social world. Of course while keeping good-manners. Don't forget to teach your child the virtues of generosity and patience. Encourage [him,her] to be warm, because feelings, sentiments risk being suppressed during this period.

		  You are in productive Cycle 8. A great period where you will have a marked attraction for dynamism, competition, power, organization, social success and above all achievement and financial profits. A certain aggressiveness, ardor, recklessness and the search for challenges will mark these years. You don't only invest yourself physically. On the psychological side, this period of management and decision taking will be just as intense. This Cycle can lead very far those who are able to manage all the power of this vibration. The lesson here is discernment, balance, the happy medium in order to progress, to enrich oneself without breaks or risks of climbing high and falling far, frequent with this number. It is up to you to use this powerful vibration intelligently, to raise and then establish your social or professional position, to master your environment well and to grow. Generosity is another of the keys to a well-lived Cycle 8 : earn, " take " a lot of money where you can find it and reinject it to the people of goodwill who need it. Thus you will play the key role of a cardiac pump in the cycle of economic exchange in which you participate. Prove your discernment, your lucidity and also concentrate on the spiritual side of things, on human values to assure an inner balance for yourself.
		- Your ambition, your search for efficiency, your desire to go quickly and sometimes your hardness during this Cycle could bring some disturbances on the emotional and sentimental level normally more demanding in flexibility and conciliation. The 8 is often linked to certain difficulties in expressing feelings. Not that they are absent, on the contrary, but they are held back (perhaps due to fright of passing for weak or to lose self-control) and sometimes you can no longer do it and it is the surging of passion. Sexually, you will want to dominate, to conquer, to keep your mastery of the area. Without a doubt, you will be more aggressive in this field. Also learn to receive better the love that can be given to you freely.
		- The lesson of this Cycle consists in initiating yourself into combativeness, conquests, great achievements and the good management of money in view of experimenting with skill the balance between success on the concrete areas and blossoming onto spiritual, humane fields. That is your real challenge. In this quest, don't neglect co-operation, friendliness (an interdependence exists between people) and flexibility. Be careful not to let yourself get tricked by mirages of materialism, power or on the social level. Don't get carried away by mistaken appearances. Know how to keep your head. Never cry " victory " too soon... and don't forget to relax regularly.
		- #8/3
		  You are in harvest Cycle 8. A rather active " retirement " ! During this period you will privilege achievement, power and assurance. Your energy and will push you to apparently late achievements (personal challenges, big projects, active management of your heritage). To be present, to master the situation are the concepts that seduce you. You want to show your combativeness and success. A certain aggressiveness, ardor and recklessness will mark this period. But you don't only invest yourself physically ; on the psychological side this period of management and decision taking will be just as intense.
		- Cycle 8 bestows an important role on you to play for your environment. You are asked to use this energy for your own success but also to make communication easier, to facilitate the circulation of money between the different people of the society and assure material success by your organizational ability. However, be careful not to fall into certain excesses. Start with your health which despite this apparent energy requires decompression and inner balance. In the emotional corner, this vibration can make you more demanding, more intolerant. Your challenge will be to be capable of flexibility, gentleness and protective concern. Otherwise some clashes are in view. Now is the time to collect, to climb rather than always battling. Use the money that you have earned ; don't miss the occasion to help those who you like and those who deserve it with your know-how and financial support (but no blind generosity).
		- #9/1
		  You are in formative Cycle 9. A delicate period for the start of youth, better later. This is due to the specificity of the number 9 vibration which refines sensitivity, pushes towards idealism, invites travelling and opening onto the world, science and man. This vast vibration is more linked to an ending than a beginning and so is quite unusual for the start of life. The energy of this number can confront you very early with things that are a bit too big, too strong or too numerous for your young shoulders, as a great wind would carry you far from shore. This Cycle will incite you very quickly to have quite a global vision of your environment, to open yourself to the world. An asset which will certainly give you a great ease in learning and allow you to acquire a mature mind very quickly (assuming that this ease isn't disturbed by too much receptivity to negative or illogical aspects from the outside world). Your refined sensitivity, your openness to others, your desire to enrich your knowledge and your idealism are also qualities with a double edge. As far as the emotions are concerned, the idealism can make it better but also worse if there is not down to earth balance on one side. On the other hand, a very refined perception can make you conscious too soon of the disguised systems of oppression and the illogicalness of your environment, this could put inner strain on you or drive you to build a cocoon, create a myth for yourself or take refuge in melancholy. That's why it would be welcome on the part of those close to you if they show patience, tenderness, understanding and that they bring you the emotional stability that you need. If you are given a stable and warm family atmosphere, your development will be better. Take things in hand to avoid these diversions. Learn to stabilize your profound nature. Set yourself a minimum level under which your temper, your humor and your confidence cannot fall. Use these number 9 vibrations positively, for altruistic habits, to apprehend new ways of seeing the world, to discover different interests and different horizons (new technologies, discoveries, ecology...). This well-orientated opening can only benefit and enrich you. Sometimes this Cycle is accompanied by a certain notoriety.
		- #9/2
		  You are in productive Cycle 9. In this section of life of idealist vibrations, all that has something to do with open-mindedness, refinement of your sensitivity, human relations, public and even spiritual life, will be important to you. It is the time of a great freedom, especially of the mind, because it seems that you no longer have too many material problems. You will start to consider those around you in a different way and look beyond your little personal interests. You will have the desire " to live " your ideal, to refine your life, to give it greater worth, a crowning. If you have talent (artistic or other) you will be pushed to develop it. The more lucky among you will find stardom. The others must be content with an increased notoriety. Your cultural demand, scientific interest, desire to travel, hunger for knowledge or your altruistic spirit can figure amongst your priorities during this period. Don't be indecisive because high caliber achievements and numerous successes are within your reach during this Cycle, rich in multiple communications. It would be a good idea to prepare psychologically to climb, to show a great margin for maneuver and to be ready to see far and wide to profit fully from the important potentialities offered by this central Cycle. A type 9 vibration that finds itself cramped, through lack of a minimum of elevation, open-mindedness and generosity on your part, could lead you to inner troubles and other annoyances.
		- The emotional will make up a part of your priorities. You will have a sense of others, a generous mind but also a greater demand in the area of ideals. Your partner will be well advised not to try to deceive you by base maneuvers. Your desire for refinement and elevation could also find itself on the level of your sex life. In Cycle 9, one sometimes risks investing a lot of time in the numerous possibilities that are offered and due to this less time is devoted to oneself. If the compensation is up to it (greater serenity, the satisfaction of living an ideal or contributing to the good of others) then perhaps some sacrifices are justified. However, be careful of the consequences for your union. Furthermore, your partner must show a great inner stability faced with your great impulses or possible self-questioning during this phase of your life. Try to re-balance your tendency with a good dose of practical-mindedness.
		- On the professional front, facilities for everything to do with leading sectors (high technology to master chef in cooking), new approaches, teaching, the arts, fashion, media, general culture, travelling, foreign contacts or contacts with a vast public and ecology. You will also be very much at ease when it's a matter of helping out (unselfishly). A vast program for which it will be necessary to take some precautions. Always be on watch to preserve your profound freedom and don't make yourself a prisoner of others even if it is for a good cause. In fact, if you lose your height you lose your efficiency. Lastly, know that during this period you will be more receptive to the outside world, your sensitivity will be greater and your desires stronger. All this signifies that you must try to avoid (in all cases be careful) disturbing situations, negative atmospheres, inner " storms " and tensions in relationships. Keep this height and this serenity which suits you so well. Learn, for your own interest and the interest of those close to you, to fix your emotions firmly, in a way to avoid all untimely overflows. Make the most of this Cycle to open your mind and to discover the world and yourself.
		- #9/3
		  You are in harvest Cycle 9. A Cycle of ideal, inner peace and openness to others presents itself to you. A favorable period for research, reading or teaching. You have the desire to share your knowledge with others. A certain idealism marks this period. Your passions go in the direction of helping others, altruism, justice, spirituality or more simply the human sciences (sociology, history, genealogy or ecology...). You could know a certain notoriety. You will be attracted to travelling, even to far-off lands in order to complete your culture. If you are not yet accustomed to this vibration, you are advised to leave new ideals to germinate in yourself and to show your open-mindedness. Don't be afraid to advance towards the unknown, to give yourself goals. Let yourself be pleasantly surprised by the possibilities of growth during this Cycle. Illuminate your intimate expression, give more meaning to your life, let yourself be charmed by the joys of altruism. The only excesses which you must be careful of are getting emotionally excited (excess of passions) and sometimes a lack of lucidity faced with the world that surrounds you. Keep your balance and make the most of your privileged Cycle.
		- #11/1
		  You are in formative Cycle 11. An interesting but not always tranquil period. This Cycle is characterized by a great need for the search of a rather spiritual knowledge and by an increased awakening (intelligence, consciousness and intuition). It is a delicate period to live in for a child, except if the family environment is ready. For this, the parents must make sure that they let their child express [himself,herself] and say how [he,she] feels even if it doesn't seem very " reasonable " or " rational ". Don't answer abruptly that " this is impossible " or " this child is a dreamer " ; it could disturb your child. Despite [his,her] youth, [he,she] could have some things to teach the adults because [he,she] is capable of perceiving things sometimes very accurately. So, it is preferable to favor a good mastery of [his,her] sensitivity (intuition, inspiration) and a healthy use of such possibilities. Help [him,her] to be confident, supply [him,her] with solid bases and good sense.
		- However, if the energy of this Cycle doesn't suit you (nervousness), it is probable that you are going to live it more often as the formative Cycle 2. This cycle is going to be under a rather feminine influence, shown by a youthfulness very marked by the protective presence of the mother (unless it is the grandmother or a big sister), probably alone in the home or assuming parental responsibilities because of the estrangement of the father. This allows us to foresee a period where one privileges friendships, tenderness, sensitivity, imagination and even dreaming. This influence presents a lot of advantages (fine qualities, kindness, intuition...) and brings an interesting point of view. However, it must not be excessive or it will lead towards a sort of emotional dependence as well as a sickly indecision at the beginning of life. It is advised to do everything so that this youthfulness can also have a place outside of the maternal protection in order that you can learn to assert yourself elsewhere, all benefiting from this feminine support. All that can help you to develop your power of decision, your autonomous ability and to manage your emotions healthily (to dominate the tendency for submission or an excessive sensitivity) will be profitable to your growth. The people close to you must give you the love that you need but without being too indulgent or resigning because this won't help you. You may be tempted to marry very young, before you have sufficiently grown, perhaps more due to the need to cling to someone or to find more quickly this protective atmosphere again, than the wish to live as a couple. For the record, the first Cycle lasts from 24 to 32 years according to the value of your Life Path.
		- #11/2
		  You are in productive Cycle 11. During this Cycle of powerful vibrations, you will have at your disposal a good dose of energy, increased ideas and inspiration. Make the most of these assets. The vibration 11, ideally incites you to put your inspirations and ideas into practice. Use your dynamism to manage your projects well. Don't be afraid to pick up speed or altitude. Such a Cycle often allows a rapid social progression or procures a certain notoriety. However, note that you must not fall into certain excesses if you want to live this period positively. Be careful not to be won over by a superiority complex (egoism, pride, intolerance, the desire to dominate) or to bubble up too much inside, which would make you stressed and incoherent. It would bring you problems. Keep a clear head. Your mission during this passionate Cycle is not to prove your superiority, but to accomplish great things and share them with others. Transmit the fruits of your talents or inspirations. During this period, don't concentrate too much on material possessions or intellectual speculation which is not really in tune with this vibration. Your centers of interest are different.
		- However, if the energy of this number 11 Cycle doesn't suit you (nervousness), it is probable that you are more often going to live this Cycle on the number 2 level. Therefore, it is a period where you will privilege marriage, alliances, work in co-operation, kindness, the feelings with all it can favor : inspiration, creativity, tact, a sense of helping others, subtlety, love but also emotional fragility, passivity and indecision.
		- #11/3
		  You are in harvest Cycle 11. A good period where you will have the tendency for an increased awakening. You will be attracted by the search for knowledge and spiritual openness. Inspiration, intuition and a good overall vision are the areas in which you will not fault. Share this with others. This Cycle can also be lived in the level 2 which is foreseen as a peaceful period with the possibility of having hobbies and a lot of friendships with a tender atmosphere. The privileged values will be co-operation, kindness and tolerance.
		- #22/2
		  You are in productive Cycle 22. It is a highly active period where you are going to privilege the notion of caliber. Whether it is a matter of construction, invention, organization or management, your activities will carry the mark of this notion. Without a doubt, you will find yourself in the position of great achiever and great organizer. Thus, your responsibilities will be important as well as your personal power. Use your ingenuity and drive to advance the collective well-being. However, be careful not to have self-interested or skimpy objectives. Don't take on an ill-intentioned superiority complex or you will risk living this powerful vibration negatively (disappointments, crushings, incredible beliefs, megalomania, mental unbalance). Your exterior achievements have a lot of importance but to keep it that way you must be alert to the good running of your inner balance, otherwise things will turn against you. In particular, don't neglect the virtues of a refreshing sleep. A certain level and a good psychological preparation is necessary to succeed fully in this Cycle ; otherwise content yourself with living in 4 of which here is the explanation.
		- If you can't put up with the vibrations in the number 22 Cycle, you will live in 4.
		- This is a period where you want to be productive and make solid constructions. You will be attracted by work and security, stability and the valorization that it procures. In your eyes, life will be something serious and constructive. Details, discipline, honesty, loyalty and discretion are some of your privileged themes. Little time and little money will be allotted to leisure (except do-it-yourself) or parties. Everything must be useful, well managed and accounted for !
		- If you like this sort of thing, this Cycle is made for you ! Use your energy and good practical sense which will easily be at your disposition during this phase to structure your life well and prepare for the future. Don't count too much on luck. If necessary ask for help, because there are some obstacles which are sometimes difficult to clear alone. You will be more at ease in an activity which requires the acceptance of a certain routine and regularity (administration or technical professions for example). Your centers of interest lean towards manual work, construction, the resolution of practical problems and down to earth things. You will be motivated by organization, discipline, the practical and traditional subjects. Sexually, you will want to be conventional. Generally not a lot of travelling (except in the professional area). In a general way, this period will allow you to develop and enhance yourself by your accomplishments, your seriousness.
		- Try to make the most of this central part of your life. Give yourself the possibility to get out of the rigid areas and change the atmosphere sometimes. Schedule some moments of relaxation, don't put too much austerity or monotony in your emotional and sensual relationships. Don't forget that these areas are necessary in a balanced life. Otherwise you can expect a troubled health (especially between the ages of 44 and 48) or unpleasant surprises within your couple.

Don't forget to benefit others with your talents. Notoriety envisaged.

		- If you can't put up with the strong vibrations in the number 22 Cycle, you will live in 4.
		- You are in harvest Cycle 4. A rather laborious retirement benefiting from the energy of this number. A rather sedentary mode of life and an interest for serious, concrete and traditional subjects.

	- ## Personal Year
	  collapsed:: true
		- The Personal Year Number constitutes one of the major vibrations that you will be confronted with during the course of your life. Numerology calculates your Personal Year Number by adding (vertically) your date and month of birth to the current year. In reducing this number we will end up with a figure between 1 and 9. Each year is thus individualized and it is interesting to know this basic element in order to understand the dominant vibration which will always accompany you during this period and in order to help you to chose the best course of action. It is necessary, nevertheless, to keep in mind that dominant vibration does not signify fate or destiny. The explanation of a Personal Year Number is only concerned with the trends that you are going to experience and it gives an indication of how you are likely to react faced with these influences. Free-will is not denied, but the simple fact is, our decision making can be more judicious when we have got a bit of information beforehand.
		- The Personal Year Numbers 1, 5 and 9, indicate huge changes, indeed the biggest faced with yet ; 4 and 8 are associated with the most evident material and financial difficulties ; as for big losses (theft, trials, friends), they will attach themselves to the numbers 7 and 8. The vibrations 7 and 9 can be linked to periods of inner tension and emotional problems. Personal Year 1, 3 and 5, are in general the most positive numbers. One's love-life can benefit quite well with the positive vibrations of 2, 5 and 6. Without a doubt, your best times are during the years which have a compatible vibration with one of your four principal numbers (Desire Number, Expression Number, Intimate Number and Birthday vibration). To arrive at a good interpretation of your Personal Year Number, it is necessary to look at your present life Cycle (i.e. phase of life and mental orientations) and your Pinnacles (concrete achievements). To complete the interpretation, certain minor elements can also be considered such as Astrological Houses, Passing Letters of the name, Year Essence or Transit.
		- Below you will find a detailed interpretation by Personal Year Number:
		- #1
		  Your Personal Year Number is 1. Start of cycle, individualization.
		- Summary : The start of a new cycle is ideal for innovation. Don't hesitate. Your attitude and initiatives are going to mark the major part of this nine year cycle. There will not be a lot of external help. Intelligent investments could be made for the future. Vivacity and some impatience.
		  After the outcome of year number 9 with probably some relationship or professional matters being called into question, you are now faced with a new start. This year number 1 in effect, starts the phase of the nine year cycle of the Personal Year Numbers. It is synonymous with commencement, production, structuring and often decision. It is a rich year for initiative and originality where you must convert your ideas into actions. The concept of openings can be seen at work, with projects, promotion, transfers and new activities. But not only at work, also with one's love- life and sometimes the openings in this regard are due to an evolution of your conception of life. It is unlikely that this vibration will serve you very well if you stay passive and indecisive because it is a vibration very much in harmony with action and enterprise. It is advised not to be too hesitant or to careless because experience shows that the attitude adopted during this year will reverberate during the whole nine year cycle...
		- Make the most of this year number 1, from the arrival of this strong energy to start projects that you have already thought about during the previous year. Also take advantage of the energy this year to change habits, to take decisions for the future, to invest in the long term (gathering the profits in year number 3 or later), start new activities or look for new openings. The nature of these activities will certainly be in harmony with the general atmosphere bound up with your Personal Cycle and your current Pinnacle. Above all look ahead. Don't neglect these opportunities for expansion and don't let yourself rest indifferent. But also don't tear along thoughtlessly, because without a doubt you will have hardly any help from outside ; it is essentially necessary to count only on yourself. This is the nature of the vibration number 1. Making the first move yourself, will lead to good results, and everything will happen quite quickly because there are less obstacles in the way than in a year number 4 for example.
		- The personal year number 1 is intensified by masculine energy (the Yang) and the accent will be put on the masculine characteristics. This is beneficial period to really get yourself together again, to develop certain areas of your personality, to be more assertive faced with certain situations and people. Be careful not to drift. It is a matter of being individual, but it does not involve being an arrogant dictator or becoming aggressive in order to impose your new opinions. It is not always easy because the others have not yet perhaps noticed that you have changed (new start) and it can result in some misunderstandings. The other side of this number can revive certain outside antagonisms, notably with the different forms of hierarchy (state, father, brother, religion, teacher etc...). Above all, this is more likely to happen when it is a woman who is becoming more active and independent. Others can sometimes feel threatened or disrupted by your energy, your radiation and they will try to put pressure on you. All will be revealed by the level of your need to change and the habits that are fixed in your unconscious. Consider, however, all of this as positive, in the sense that if this year attracts conflictual situations, it is to allow one to assert oneself or to liberate oneself from burdensome ways and imperfections that have been guarded in the unconscious for some years.
		- Love life
		- This year's vibration will have a major impact on your life. Your influence on others or on your partner will be reinforced. Do not abuse this too much however, because it could turn against you next year. According to your way of living within this vibration, you will either appreciate your partner's submission (the number 1 liking to be dominant), or [his,her] sense of initiative, and resourcefulness. It's up to you.
		- These emotional successes, however, are relative to your Key number (the day and month of birth added together and then reduced to a number between 1 and 9. For example 12 + 9 = 21 = 3).
		- Key 1 : Few results. Concentrate rather on professional matters.
		  Key 2 : You concentrate a lot on professional matters and tend to forget about those close to you. However, there is a possibility of beneficial friendships at work.
		  Key 3 : Success in love.
		  Key 4 : Mixed outcome. More favorable to single people in finding a partner rather than those who already have one.
		  Key 5 : A very dynamic year. If there is going to be a marriage set the date for the months of April-May or alternatively during the final quarter of the year.
		  Key 6 : Some rather short-lived meetings. Other areas of your life are more dominant, notably within a couple where you set up some projects.
		  Key 7 : You will be pushed without a doubt, to start a new emotional relationship (with you current or new partner) this year. Yet be on guard, if you get involved too quickly you risk finding yourself in a complicated situation, that you will have to suffer for several years.
		  Key 8 : A year favorable to marriage, but paradoxically not to love, because you do not know what you really want. There will be a change for the better in year 2.
		  Key 9 : Some partnership strains during the middle of this year. Stay calm and let the crisis pass. For the single people, there will be some meetings, but also some obstacles to get in the way.
		  Professional life
		- This will be a dynamic year and allow you to put some useful axis into place for the future. Do not hesitate to make the first move and persevere because next year will be dedicated to the finer details of your projects. You can also use this year to improve your image, to be more radiant, to enlarge your territory, to be ready to change if necessary. Stop relying too much on others if this was the case before, because this year you must find your independence alone.
		- Health
		- In a general way, give yourself oxygen, purify yourself. Adopt a more healthy and balanced diet, opt for a bit of clean living. Choose fresh foods, non refined and non hydrogenated oils, etc... This year is generally a favorable one for health. Only those with a Key number 1 or 8 are at risk of stress and even aggressiveness, thus it is essential to relax regularly.
		- #2
		  Your Personal Year Number is 2. Cooperation, sensitivity.
		- Summary : The time to perfect previous experiences. It is necessary to co-operate with others and fetch their help too. It is the time to consider the small details, to save up money or to get married. Duality in relationships. Some friends, but do not be too confident in them.
		- In a general way, it is the period where we cultivate what has been sown in the previous year. This number 2 vibration is feminine (Yin). It is going to influence or put an accent on co-operation and relationships with others. This will be a time for friends, helping others, love, marriage. On the negative side, divorce for those who refuse to live in harmony with this vibration (harmony or conflict, the calm sea or the wild ocean, according also to last years behavior). Emotions have a lot of importance this year as well as sensitivity, perfectionism and women in a general sort of way. It is a matter of using this vibration intelligently, that is, to strengthen last year undertakings but also not to leave oneself overflowing with emotional things. The emotions arrive at just the right time to shape your previous year's projects. If year number 1 helped you give birth to new ideas, to make decisions, to express your individuality then this year will help supplement these achievements, as a sort of welcome sedimentation. On the other hand, this year can bring out the passive, indecisive side in you or just test you for the resistances you had in year one, but this time emotionally.
		- Professional life
		- After the awakening of last year you have probably started some sort of project(s). To make these successful you must now work to perfect any little details still outstanding because these will be the cause of the final success or failure of the project. Try not to be rigid or impatient, do not hang on obstinately to the mental sketches or plan that you made last year. Know how to adapt. It will be necessary to change things a little, maybe to withdraw in order to look to others and be inspired by their ideas. Leave things to come to you to a certain extent, because co-operation, listening and consolidation are the key words this year. See the people that can help you, make your relationships more relaxed. Last year you had to advance alone, find your independence. This year needs teamwork rather than independence, there are new people to meet, collaborations, contracts. You could find a new job. But try not to let yourself become blindly confident, with a lack of objectivity, because it will make you vulnerable especially with important associates (implicating money). Try to keep yourself in a positive environment. Be careful to avoid doubting yourself and just giving up, because this year will test you in this respect.
		- Love life
		- This year is placed under the sign of duality. Love affairs, marriage, agreements but also a possibility of conflicts, criticism or divorce (according to the way you live this vibration). Nevertheless, this is a generally positive period and you can count on good relationships with women or people endowed with kindness. The number 2 vibration gives out intuition, receptivity and availability. Listen well to your own inspirations and don't hesitate to cultivate this sensitivity. Accept background roles during this period, it will allow you to prepare and strengthen yourself for what follows. It is often better to stand back slightly before jumping. It is worth knowing that this year is quite capable of turning gossips and critics against you. It is not worth wasting your time on trying to understand why, it is just a part of your emotional lesson on balance. Show your indifference and it will stop. Sterile disputes don't put you on the road of advancement, in fact quite to the contrary. Try to be relaxed and friendly this year, be tactful and avoid interfering with those who do not concern you.
		- For women, year number 2 can awaken unconscious conflicts linked with feminine polarity (female relationships, mother, sister, one's own femininity, social status or romantic love). If there is an underlying emotional disagreement of this type, it is highly probable that it will be intensified. Thus, you can find yourself in situations that will cause this problem to arise again, which will help you to understand the emotional block better and so allow you to overcome it. Don't try to dodge it, be honest with yourself. It is a matter of maturing and blossoming (with your emotional expression), not to leave yourself submerged by silly emotions or to bury feelings deeper due to environmental pressures. For men, the awakening of this feminine energy can be disconcerting for those who are not used to expressing emotions, those who keep that sort of thing hidden. In fact, it is particularly beneficial for men (contrary to general belief) to have to put up with such things as intuition and sensitivity. It can only make things better. Even World Champions lean on qualities said to be feminine.
		- However, all this is relative to your Key number (the day and month of birth added together and then reduced to a number between 1 and 9. For example 12 + 9 = 21 = 3).
		- Key 1 : Good emotional balance for single people. Meetings possible during the second half of the year. Not a very eventful period for couples.
		  Key 2 : A relatively favorable period.
		  Key 3 : A very emotional period (affections). Some quite intense meetings for the unattached, who want to find their kindred spirit. Nothing guaranteed however, concerning the duration of these relationships, particularly those that started during July, August or September. Some small crises for couples. The success of this year is linked to a certain extent to how good you are at making up and your ability to be tender.
		  Key 4 : If there is a mutual understanding, the old problems must find a solution due to a new conception of your relationship based on tact and mutual respect. Be vigilant, particularly at the end of the year.
		  Key 5 : A rather glorious and exalting time waits for you. Highs and lows, with a positive end to the year for those who are single ; some setbacks for those couples who are not endowed with a lot of tact and understanding of each other.
		  Key 6 : Except for the end of the year, this year is a favorable time for marriage. The end of the year finds you wanting to be alone.
		  Key 7 : The first three-quarters of this year will be disappointing, but don't become disheartened because the end of the year will be very positive with long term repercussions.
		  Key 8 : A very favorable climate. Single people will find someone to suit them, even if the romantic side of things stay a little in background.
		  Key 9 : Some disappointments for the single people and doubts for the couples. Be very patient, do not abandon your dream.
		  Health
		- Your emotional unbalance will be your weak point. A possible excess of sensitivity. Fix certain limits for yourself and do not cross them. Relax, do some sport. Do not let yourself spend too much time on thinking about internal tensions, that can put pressure on the digestive system (and eventually lead to surgical intervention years later if it turns into an obsession). Think about healthy drinking. Give your body a helping hand with a course of vitamins and minerals. Reduce your intake of animal fats by choosing to use non refined and non hydrogenated vegetable oils.
		- #3
		  Your Personal Year Number is 3. Optimism, creativity, sociability.
		- Summary : A year of success and creativity. Undertakings, social events, invitations. A second chance to make a new start. Literary or oral expression, selling will be favored. A year of seduction and flirting. Sometimes birth. Happiness, good luck, but a tendency to over-spend. An excellent year for creativity, new ideas, expression, communication and exchange. The efforts made in year 1 and 2 are rewarded in year 3.
		- This is the moment to express yourself, using the different means that life has to offer you. You want to be creative, to communicate, to share your ideas and to organize your spare time a bit better. Don't hesitate to expand your exchanges because Year 3 is a period of blossoming and joy to live. This year will help you to liberate yourself and to be a bit less internal (if it was necessary for you). Whatever means you use, make the most of this year because next year will not be as pleasant.
		- Professional life
		- You are entering into a period of professional protection and blooming. Literature, the arts, oral expression, the media, public relations and thus commerce and exchanges will be favored this year. Your mind's vivacity, your creativity and your sense of contact will be stimulated. You can make the most of this by widening your horizons or changing fields. If you feel more at ease in one of the above areas than the others then go with the feeling, because this vibration is going to favor those who externalize their feelings, create or communicate (exchange).
		- This vibration can be as equally useful when it comes to personal matters. Thus, you could discover that you have got some abilities, increase your confidence and be more radiant. In using completely this vibration, you will see your imagination and good sense of humor take the front stage and others will find you to be charming. Your sensitivity will change, you will see the world differently. Make space for pleasure and joy. Throw away your usual limitations, use your dynamism to do new things, to improve your know-how. This year will also be favorable to the sporty type. In order to be successful this year it will be necessary to avoid superficiality, gossiping about other peoples business and above all ill-considered expenditure. It is your creativity and success that must be given preference. Be careful of what you say or write ; be sure that you will not regret it.
		- Love life
		- Full of charm and good sense of humor, the probability of you meeting somebody is quite high. You liven up the party. Therefore, this is a good year for love. It will be a good idea to keep your head, because some of the relationships you find yourself in will be fleeting. You will be quite sensitive to the loss of friendships as well as to people (powerful or not) ignoring you or taking your place on front stage. Year 3 will perhaps see the birth of not only professional openings but also a child.
		- However, all this is relative to your Key number (the day and month of birth added together and then reduced to a number between 1 and 9. For example 12 + 9 = 21 = 3).
		- Key 1 : A new dimension to the life of a couple (more feelings and more sharing). The beginning and end of the year are favorable for friendly relations for single people, but there will be disappointment around the time of July, August or September.
		  Key 2 : An immense appetite for freedom and joy of living. If you are prepared to allow someone important to enter your emotional life, a meeting will be possible from March to June. This person will bring you a lot and the liaison will be official from the following year.
		  Key 3 : A little too much dispersal and a threat of becoming unstable. Relationships will be a little upsetting. Try to stand back and look at things a bit more objectively.
		  Key 4 : Some emotional tensions and meetings that do not come to anything in the first half of this year. Opt rather for leisure activities and your own well-being. Profit from the other positive aspects of this year.
		  Key 5 : Single people do not really have their mind on love matters. But those who are part of a couple will have the desire to undertake different projects with their partner.
		  Key 6 : Single people who find a partner that gives them the tenderness that they need, will become more fragile emotionally. This relationship does not seem to be permanent. If you live as a couple, your emotions will become fresher and the simplicity of this freshness of attitude will be beneficial to your relationship.
		  Key 7 : Great potential for seduction and dynamism. There will be no serious relationships for single people before July.
		  Key 8 : Disappointments for single people (except that a relationship started last year will become stronger). Concentrate on your personal well-being.
		  Key 9 : You will have a lot of magnetism. But watch out for setbacks (notably in Spring) and excessive enthusiasm. Couples : try not to be too overwhelming because things must change slowly. Single people : a number of friendships but only one will withstand.
		  Health
		- This year will be characterized by a lot of dynamism and optimism. If you have the tendency to be a bit greedy, this number 3 vibration could well lead you to be excessive. Also be careful of emotional upsets (depending on your Key number), because emotionally you will be open to diverse problems. This year willingly allows for a change of look with regard to the body and how it is presented.
		- Certain problems not overcome since the last time that you were in the Personal Year Number 9 can reappear. This is the moment to tackle them from a different angle and at least turn the page. If your Personal Year Number after having been added up vertically reduces to 21, it is generally more positive that if it had reduced to 12.
		- #4
		  Your Personal Year Number is 4. Stabilization, work, rigor.
		- Summary : The year of effort and seriousness. Construction for the future. Possible hardship. Tiredness. The first harvest or the first bill according to your behavior in the last few years. Not much time for pleasures.
		- After a year of joy and expression, material contingencies demand your attention. This vibration is going to place importance on work. Try to take pleasure in this area, rather than going against the current flow with it, because if you fight this vibration, it will only increase the risk of mad surprises or limitations. Thus this period is one of the construction of solid bases and effort. Do not neglect the small details, your construction must be made to last. It is the last year of the 9 years cycle to install your bases (from the first year when you made the sketches).
		- A surplus of courage would be useful here because the risk is that the work will be long-term and you will have to prove your perseverance. It is your affairs, your work, your house (as far as the upkeep goes) that are important this year. Keep an eye on them. Your success will be a result of your constancy and tenacity. Be orderly, methodical and practical. Help others. Do not let yourself go during this period.
		- If difficulties, struggles and shortages must have their place somewhere, it is generally during year 4. It is your perseverance, your logical mind and your forethought (due to what you are reading now) that will see you through it. Face your obligations. Be as honest, loyal and stable as possible. Be patient with delays and limitations. Avoid being tempted to start new projects, it is not a good time.
		- Some people can live this vibration by working on themselves ; allowing themselves progression and internal purification. In it's negative form, this vibration can reveal an underlying conflict linked to work. For example, the children could feel abandoned and unconsciously chose an indirect way to make you aware of it. You could even feel guilty or uncomfortable with working too hard and this is because you have already experienced it with your parents spending their time working when you were a child.
		- Love life
		- This is the moment to stabilize your love life and to think of building a future. It is not especially a good year to start new things ; you could even have to face a waiting period when it comes to unifying projects. It is possible that you will experience certain problems when it comes to expressing emotions. You could just feel a little cramped. Try not to get too annoyed with others. Do not show that you are not satisfied with them. Advice for partners : show your reliable, serious side. Be aware that someone experiencing year 4 needs tangible signs of reassurance.
		- However, all this is relative to your Key number (the day and month of birth added together and then reduced to a number between 1 and 9. For example 12 + 9 = 21 = 3).
		  Key 1 : This vibration is favorable to those who live as part of a couple, because they will strengthen their bond. It is not a good year for new relationships.
		  Key 2 : Single people with this Key number are certainly going to have a great moment in their emotional life with a solid relationship looking towards a harmonious future for a number of years. Couples will end up by becoming closer and reinforcing their agreement for the future.
		  Key 3 : Disappointments until the Autumn. You will be perturbed. But there will be a change for the better at the end of the year for couples and especially for single people who will have the chance to enter into a new, long- lasting relationship (over 12 years), provided that your partner is in Personal Year 2 or 6.
		  Key 4 : A mixed year. At the start you lose confidence in yourself, but you finish the year strengthened because you will have taken the time to resolve your problems or thanks to a new friendship (especially single people).
		  Key 5 : Your interest will be focused on your professional or family activities. The accent is on seriousness. In your emotional life it is the strength of the bond between you and your pattern that will be important for you. Existing friends and lovers will benefit from this tendency. For single people, the birth of a relationship is possible at the end of the year. If a relationship does materialize, it will last quite a long time (certainly over 12 years).
		  Key 6 : Couples will come to realize what an argument really is during the first six months of this year, and they will be over little things. It is important for you to make sure that your partner respect you and understand your expectations without having to raise your voice ! Happily, things change for the better. Single people : burdensome solitude for the first three months, followed by a very happy period (July to December) as it is probable that you will meet someone who changes your life.
		  Key 7 : A very good period for those who live in a couple. The emotional climate is a bit more dull for the others. Perhaps a new friendship in the second half of the year, but it is fragile. It is up to you to decide whether you would like to maintain it for the future.
		  Key 8 : Disappointment and solitude for the single people, but there are always exceptions to the rule. There are tensions for the couples whose relationship lacks frankness, fervor or depth. It will be necessary for you to think about larger issues than mundane routines if you want to make it through. There is a risk of break-up during July, August and September. Simple friendships will be favored for everyone this year.
		  Key 9 : A very positive meeting for those who are generally pleasant, and a rather negative one for the others (at the end of the year). It is a similar situation for couples. However, it is worth avoiding divorce this year, it is not the good moment.
		  Health
		- Keep watch on your health this year. You could suffer from over-work and see your existing problems intensify. Notably tiredness, joint problems or bone problems, skin, teeth (especially night bruxism if you are anxious). Breath properly, relax your body and mind. Take things as they come, do not force things, because you will not get very far like that.
		- #5
		  Your Personal Year Number is 5. Freedom, novelty, expansion.
		- Summary : Break free. A very varied period, generally positive. Charm and flirts. A year of short term things. Favorable for the finances, travelling and change.
		- It is a year of pleasures, of change, of liberty in the aim of self-expansion, but also to allow you to learn to use your free-will. In effect, the number 5 symbolizes the awareness of one's freedom or possibilities (you begin to use these possibilities with whatever degree of wisdom). This period will be full of life. There can be a number of changes, mutations, an awakening of your personality, travelling, flirting, some meetings and sometimes some unexpected adventures. If you envisage a move, an expansion of your activities or a trip abroad, this is a good year for it. If there were not any significant changes in year number 1, there might be this year. The changes will turn out well if you have lived positively through the four previous years. Otherwise, it is time to adopt a more healthy attitude. In all cases, all the weight carried over the past four years can be removed now.
		- Professional life
		- This is a year when new horizons will open up for you. If decisions are taken with care, they will come out onto a profitable future. You will only have to prove how you can adapt and how resourceful you are. This should not pose too many problems because your mind, imagination, intuition and curiosity will be brilliant this year. Use this desire for vivacity to be more flexible than your competitors, to easily adapt to the unexpected (and the unexpected will turn up this year, especially if your Key number is 2 or 6), and do not hesitate to try out the most promising options. You will have luck on your side and money matters are favored. Increase your personal capital. The more reckless among you should increase your investments or develop your activities. Without a doubt, there will be more moves and contracts than usual. But keep in mind that projects and outcomes can take unexpected directions during this year of big changes. So, try not to be too euphoric or hasty (especially Keys 2, 3, 7 & 9).
		- Love life
		- This year is full of short term things, movement and charm. You certainly feel the urge to search for pleasure, in all forms. The routine of last year has no interest for you now, in fact it irritates you. You have the desire to move and to feel as free as the wind. A great need to enjoy the present moment and to become rich with some of the marvelous experiences that life can offer. This period is full of riches of all kinds. Love, sexuality and personal radiance seem to take a more important place for you this year. For some of you, it is the season of new adventures or conquests (often short-lived), an other way to take advantage of this vibration number 5. The year of sensual and sexual searching, the year in which you love to be seductive just for it's own sake. Accordingly, a very strong impulse can push you to run away from smothering situations and fight against those who want to hold you back or block your path. Advice for the partner of someone in a Personal Year Number 5 : to avoid the desire that is in year number 5 people to look elsewhere, put your vivacious side forward, show your coolness and accentuate your eroticism.
		- However, all this is relative to your Key number (the day and month of birth added together and then reduced to a number between 1 and 9. For example 12 + 9 = 21 = 3).
		- Key 1 : Magnetism, sensuality, fertility. Fickle emotional life.
		  Key 2 : A good period for couples. If your relationship started last year, be careful of the trap of this vibration that push you to excesses or suddenly make you feel tired of your partner. Do not make your partner suffer.
		  Key 3 : Numerous meetings for single people. But if you envisage a shared life, the course will be rough (to start with anyway). Select your partners carefully. Be sure that you both have the same intentions. Couples will have a strong libido. You will want to devote time to your partner.
		  Key 4 : A lot of passion and sensuality.
		  Key 5 : A serious meeting (followed by a marriage, but not before next year) is envisaged before October. Be careful that your slightly "over the top" sensuality does not lead you to make unwise choices. Do not be excessive. A good period for couples until the summer.
		  Key 6 : Single people will be able to bring themselves pleasure (in a limited way), but try not to create illusions. A romantic time for couples.
		  Key 7 : Harmony for those living as part of a couple. The single people who feel at ease have a possible meeting waiting for them, which will be happy and lasting. But you could ruin or disturb it by your desire for freedom and easy pleasures. Be responsible.
		  Key 8 : Passionate year.
		  Key 9 : Love, passion and adventure for single people. A slightly heavy atmosphere for couples. Let yourself breath and get out of the routine.
		  The rhythm of this year will be strong. Vibration number 5 is going to confront you with new experiences, even temptations. You can make the most of your freedom, but do not be careless and always try to remember the lessons that you have already learnt. Excesses will either be paid for immediately or during year 7. This year can be pleasant and enriching if we act intelligently.
		- Health
		- You will be in good shape this year. But be careful if your Key number is 3 or 8 because there is a risk of blows, bumps and sometimes an accident. Think about what you do. Keep calm. Do not put excessive strain on yourself physically. Be cautious when it comes to sex and eating (you will look for pleasure in this area). Check the quality of the food that you eat and do not consume to much sugar.
		- Watch your irritability, instability, your tendency to be excessive and be on guard for jealousy in others.
		- #6
		  Your Personal Year Number is 6. Harmony, responsibility.
		- Summary : Your surroundings are going to become your main interest (family, house, comfort, decoration, well-being, marriage). More family or professional responsibilities. Investments and money matters are favored.
		- After a perhaps carefree year, often rich in movement and change, the accent will now be on one or several of the following areas : family, marriage, family life, private and professional responsibilities, finances, devotion or sacrifice, obligations, the search for harmony and stability, as well as solving personal problems (often to do with love). If it seems to be a positive year, you will have the opportunity for promotion. Otherwise responsibilities will be harder to manage, rather intrusive than desired. For example, the people around you could encroach upon your territory and try to get something from you. The children could be painful. The house could need repairing and new responsibilities could also come to overload your shoulders. However, you need not become morose. This period is supposed to bring out your sense of being helpful and capacity to spread harmony. Do not let yourself be dominated, submerged by your environment. Play the game, but in taking the wheel. So do not let yourself suffer or be exploited. It will probably be necessary for you to show your devotion to duty, to adapt and to give without necessarily being thanked. Try to keep the happy medium, don't feel sorry for yourself and this period will bring satisfaction. It is a phase where it is worth spreading harmony and resolving the crises (gently but firmly) rather than aggravating them.
		- Professional life
		- The year 6 is one of the family and it's shelter. It will be favorable for investments especially for everything that concerns the home, interior decoration and comfort. If you possess an artistic talent, this year will support it because vibration 6 is also one of the aesthetic and harmony. The grip of responsibilities can also be linked to a promotion at work or a modification of the nature of your work. You will have some choices to make. Others will come to you for advice. A favorable year for commerce linked to body care (including products) and fitness etc...
		- Love life
		- You will feel a stronger emotional demand than usual. You will need to be understood, you will search for more security or sympathy from those around you. If it is normal in this period to appear obliging to others, it will not be necessary to be too much so especially when it comes to interfering into other peoples business.
		- Love, romance, tolerance and the sense of conciliation are the strong aspects of the number 6 vibration. It can carry with it opposing situations : a quiet year, a marriage but also the return of old problems, a threat of divorce because it is going to place a lot of importance on your love relationships and therefore test them to enable you to renew them or make them stronger. Once the irritating attitudes of everyone are subdued or changed, you can start again from a better basis. If you are single, this year will stimulate your desire to find a companion or spouse. A very important meeting (for your love life) could happen without you having been on the look out. If there are under-lying tensions in your couple, there is a strong chance that they will become worse in order for you to be able to understand (calmly) the causes and how to resolve them. Success is within your reach. All you have to do is to use the conciliating and pacific vibrations that are at your disposal. Do not hesitate to give a bit more tenderness, take pleasure in doing little things for others. Sow the seeds and you will reap the harvest. Your need for profound communication will intensify. When we flow with the rhythm of this vibration, we need to be more reassured (in love relationships) and coaxed. But we are fragile if treated coldly or harshly. This need of harmony and human warmth must not make you become over emotional, in a sort of avoidance of reality. This is a possible tendency if your personal numbers are already linked to the number 6. Look at situations soundly and clearly.
		- However, all this is relative to your Key number (the day and month of birth added together and then reduced to a number between 1 and 9. For example 12 + 9 = 21 = 3).
		- Key 1 : A year that is finally pleasant and beneficial for those that are still single. Married people must keep their calm during April, May and June.
		  Key 2 : A very good year for single people, in particular from October onwards. Some frictions during the summer for married people. A little more attention and all will return to normal.
		  Key 3 : An occasion to find the ideal person will be on offer to single people. It will be necessary to be ready and to know how to identify [him,her]. Couples will live in harmony, except perhaps during the summer due to unexpected events.
		  Key 4 : You will concentrate all of your attention on your new partner or existing one, to the point of neglecting your other activities a little.
		  Key 5 : Your emotional life will bloom.
		  Key 6 : A pleasant atmosphere. Favorable for unions.
		  Key 7 : A very romantic atmosphere for single people who will easily find their ideal partner. A long-term relationship in view. A good atmosphere for married people, who will look to deepen their mutual understanding and put more value on their life as a couple.
		  Key 8 : An important and long-lasting meeting for single people. Marriage is favorable during second half of the year. Family projects (improvement of surroundings, a new baby). A good year.
		  Key 9 : Good fortune for single people with a long-lasting commitment (highly possible). A risk of a break down for married people during April, May or June. Moderate the atmosphere. For everyone, new friendships will be healthy and enriching.
		  Please note that if your Personal Year Number 6 came from a 15 (after the vertical addition and reduction of the total), the sensuality and non-verbal communication will be at front stage. If the 6 came from 33, the accent will be more on responsibilities. If it came from the number 24, it will be necessary to overcome certain difficulties, especially to do with love.
		- Health
		- A weakening due to overwork. Possible urinary related problems, accumulated toxins, bone related problems and tensions caused by stress. They are the physical effects of your psychological folding under the weight of responsibility. Be careful not to allow your problems to get on top of you ! Don't stock them in yourself ! Do not look for compensation of your emotional problems in chocolate and sugary things.
		- #7
		  Your Personal Year Number is 7. Introspection, reflection, calm.
		- Summary : A year where we must stand back and make an effort to understand. Take time before advancing. Advised against change. Intellectual work is preferred. A certain solitude. Do not make investments, but there is the possibility of a gamble if you are the type of person who attracts money.
		- This period is one of a general slowing up, a sort of Sabbath year to allow to get your bearings after two years of bubbling activity in 5 and 6. It is a period of grasping consciousness, the day of rest to contemplate (7th day = Sunday) and to find your footing in making it through the 9 year cycle correctly. A phase of internalization beneficial for reflection, meditation, search but, nevertheless, a lot can happen... if you don't look for things to happen. A period which abandons material or financial aspects and also a little the love life. A period of harmony for fair people, a period of solitude and hardship for the others.
		- Make the most of this year favorable to the mind, to refine your consciousness and put yourself on the right path towards wisdom, inner peace. But also keep your good humor because it is particularly important this year to enjoy what you do rather than concentrating attention on goals or latent gloom. Avoid being too rational, too attached to your mental vision. Stand back, gain height. If necessary question some of your conceptions, habits and conditionings. Reflect on the past to improve your current strategy and your future. Think about your mission in life. This calm period allows you to raise your level of consciousness and may be to fathom out your innermost unconscious motivations. This information can be precious. If you know how to listen to your inner-self, you could learn new revelations or perspectives. Try to stay facing in the right direction, don't allow yourself to doubt, to be discouraged or confused (by outside events). Cultivate serenity.
		- Professional life
		- Intellectual work, research and writing will be favored. Although this number 7 vibration insists on introspection, reflection and the possibility of material limitation, don't run away from the concrete and everyday aspects of your life. It is still necessary for you. In general, you will have the tendency to avoid noise and agitation during this period. This will make you more detached or thoughtful than usual and thus misunderstandings are possible with those around you. Wait for a global slowing down of your activities (and certainly the number of obstacles). In principle money matters are not a good point. Only one or two nice surprises are likely to come your way. Make plans for the future, but hold yourself back financially. Be patient, watch. Wait for next year. If your situation allows it try to relax.
		- Love life
		- Even if your love life is not menu of the day, nothing will prevent you from relaxing your grey matter with romantic activities. You are going to enjoy intellectual friendships. Advise for the spouse : A person in year 7 has a tendency to be a bit absent, faraway. To attract [his,her] attention use your intellectual tools, throw yourself into great discussions with [him,her]. Try to be on the same wavelength.
		- However, all this is relative to your Key number (the day and month of birth added together and then reduced to a number between 1 and 9. For example 12 + 9 = 21 = 3).
		- Key 1 : A forsaken emotional life.
		  Key 2 : A need for solitude, retreat.
		  Key 3 : Euphoria for those who solidify a relationship that was started last year. But watch out for a drop in enthusiasm.
		  Key 4 : A year marked by euphoria, inner peace or the taste for mysterious or secret relationships for some of you. Single people will lack judgment. Be careful of errors.
		  Key 5 : If you have made the most of the previous years vibrations, there will be a consolidation of your relationship and a marriage could be envisaged during the first half of the year. A new union is possible for the others, but it will be of an unexpected nature. A good quality of life for couples.
		  Key 6 : You are going to focus on the holy or spiritual aspect of the life of a couple. You will be allergic to all forms of baseness or hypocrisy.
		  Key 7 : The reaping of years 5 and 6. Serenity or solitude, moral debt or suffering, with the necessity to make an adjustment in your behavior.
		  Key 8 : Honesty and straightforwardness will be rewarded ; hypocrisy penalized. Beware. April to September is a good period for marriage.
		  Key 9 : Quite a heavy atmosphere. The desire to tidy things up and then to leave to discover a new horizon.
		  Health
		- A certain psychic fragility, a weariness. Stay calm. Do not try to force things (especially not mentally). Harmonize your energies. Do not allow dark and depressing ideas to get the better of you. Stay simple-minded, give yourself air, be resourceful. The more fresh and clear your mind is the better you will carry yourself. Avoid dispersal.
		- Be prudent, this is a generally bad year on the financial front (in particular if we want to be active or speculate in this area....or if your number 7 comes from the secondary number 16). Do not push things too much. Be content to observe and allow things to come to you. Watch out for apparently good circumstances where there will be all sorts of tricks.
		- The number 7 vibration can sometimes make people receptive to fanaticism, cunning speeches (religious or political) and to artificial things (drugs, alcoholism). Be aware of these traps.
		- #8
		  Your Personal Year Number is 8. Material values, power.
		- Summary : A year of management and higher energy. Need to act, need to achieve. Material and social strength. Financial matters take the front seat. Favorable to cold-blooded people. Power, hierarchy. A risk of highs and lows. It is necessary to be vigilant.
		- You are entering a period where commitment (courage, ambition, demands), accomplishment and power will be the high values. It is a year that is going to put material things at the top of the list of importance. It can bring you material satisfaction, progress at work, increased revenue, better social status, more personal power or talent to run your life. A favorable year in which to realize ambitions. This is applicable to those who lived positively during the previous years of their cycle and in particular year 4. In effect this vibration number 8 is very energetic. It is going to accentuate the successes as well as the setbacks. Karmicly renowned, a negative year 8 is going to be accompanied by losses, deceptions, punishments and even accidents, legal cases, theft or unexpected health problems. The negative side to the number 8 vibration corresponds generally to the more "pushy" characters, those who are too materialistic and drive for success by any means necessary. We speak about karma because those who (by ignorance or greed) ridicule the law of this vibration can be really tough and capable of putting their problems onto others, so that the inevitable readjustments will not come to them directly. The losses can immediately hit those around them or effect less important areas of their lives. All depends on their stubbornness in this bad approach to money and power. So it can last a long time until the consequences appear. It can even stretch over several lifetimes for those who accept the idea of reincarnation.
		- The lesson to be learnt this year is a little ambiguous. It is twofold and necessitates a spiritual master as well as a material one. This vibration tells us that material values, social success, ambition and the exercise of power only have a future if the mind or spirit behind it aim for expansion, freedom and growth... for everyone and not just for petty selfish interests. All attempts at egoistic gain by unscrupulous means will go against the natural law of growth for everybody and sooner or later these attempts will have to be corrected. You can have wealth, power and management but you must go about it the right way. In principle these comments do not have to concern you, since this type of contemptuous person despises the laws of the mind and by the way esoterism. So it's highly improbable that they read these lines. However, it is worth being quite prudent during the passage of this strong vibration, because the trouble can equally effect those who lack vigilance. Take precautions against theft, fraud, losses, accidents, swindling or legal action. Remember that the 8 has a feminine (Yin) nature. This is it's reckless, demanding and materialistic side that gives it it's unfeeling appearance. However, the ideal 8 is characterized by her mind, breadth, capacity to master and natural generosity before all else. Besides, the bad characters (pushy type) feel more or less definitely that they lack natural breadth, that is why they attach so much importance to image, appearances and to the consideration of others in order to raise their own importance and try unsuccessfully to give themself this nobility lacking to their personality.
		- Ideally, the 8 is a great organizer, an intelligent manager (the opposite of a simple chief of staff) who is co-operative, benevolent and knows how to avoid egoism and fruitless hierarchy games. The number 8 likes power, money, organization, but in order to solve problems and raise the general standard of life. A protector coming into contact with demanding, over-bearing sides, but the two sides of the number 8 will be balanced. It is no use having wealth and apparent power without spiritual breadth.
		- Professional life
		- If you made the most of year 7, a period of looking inward, you will have reached this period with increased inner strength (serenity, cold-blood). This will be very useful when confronted by the challenges that wait for you. Challenges linked to sport, bettering the self, money, organization and power. It is highly possible that you will have to prove your authority. If this is the case, don't fall into the trap of confusing natural authority (accepted by all) with a tendency for dictatorship. It is a thin line. This vibration can also put you sometimes in contrary situations where you will be confronted with a form of protection that is a bit excessive (under somebody's supervision) as well as injustice or criticism. But it is always with the idea of making you understand all the aspects of power, the good and the bad.
		- Your dealings with money will be particularly important during this year. Wait for the highs as well as the lows. You can harvest the fruits of your past initiatives, undertake new things, do business etc... but only if you use this vibration to the full. In this case, it is necessary to be ready to fight, to get back on your feet after a setback and to assert your authority with determination to realize your aim in your field of interest. During this year, it is worth staying concentrated and not crying "victory" to all the world. Build and strengthen your positions, manage your interests as best you can and reclaim the money that is owed to you. It will be a matter of proving your audacity, but also mastery and vigilance to use this vibration to it's full potential. Of course not everyone finds pleasure in this type of challenge where it is necessary to keep their head.
		- Love life
		- This is quite a delicate period waiting for you. All will depend on your mastery and ability to balance between two extremes. Actually your priorities lay elsewhere, a place that will not allow your romantic life to bloom into Spring-time ! You will seem to be hard and sometimes abrupt. Sex and seduction has in some way the signification of experimentation and power for you this year. Shrewd partners will be aware not to give in too easily or the number 8 person (hunter type) will become bored.
		- In a general sort of way, vigilance imposes itself on the emotional life. Moderate your requirements. Keep a balance between you and your partner. Don't be afraid to make concessions, to be more flexible, otherwise your partnership will suffer a crisis. This year could be favorable for a marriage that brings you financial freedom to a certain extent.
		- However, all this is relative to your Key number (the day and month of birth added together and then reduced to a number between 1 and 9. For example 12 + 9 = 21 = 3).
		- Key 1 : Couples, don't stir up arguments. Nothing in view for single people.
		  Key 2 : A new relationship envisaged for single people. A secure and favorable marriage for those who have been seeing each other for a long time. Couples relationships will be centered on the pleasure of material things.
		  Key 3 : Couples, a tendency to be intolerant could bring a number of arguments. Say what you want to say, but try not to raise your tone. Not much new for the single people. Marriage is favorable for those already in a relationship.
		  Key 4 : An improved emotional life for couples. Marriage is possible for the women in this vibration that are already in a relationship.
		  Key 5 : Some slips that could disrupt your plans. Talk, be patient, keep your stability, make concessions and all must improve at the end of the year.
		  Key 6 : Disinterest.
		  Key 7 : Marriage is possible for those people that already have a positive relationship. Single people could have little adventures with the persons that they often spend time with. Couples will be interested in putting more emotion and spirituality into their union.
		  Key 8 : Stay calm.
		  Key 9 : A relatively disrupting and confusing period for couples and single people. A favorable year for those who are in love and just about to get married.
		  Health
		- This is a year of all or nothing. Great vitality or a mass of little aches and pains (back, sciatica, diverse neuralgias, digestive problems, palpitations, general tiredness, putting on weight,....). Make the most of this demanding period to become more healthy and self-disciplined. Demonstrate your self-control (e.g. stop smoking, don't eat so much or so quickly). Be careful because this year can place you under the sign of accidents (little or more serious) and food poisoning. So, be cautious, particularly when driving.
		- A Personal Year Number that was arrived at via the number 17 is often more favorable that if it came from a 26 (higher risk of swindling and wrong association).
		- #9
		  Your Personal Year Number is 9. Final achievement, purification, sensitivity, tolerance.
		- Summary : Overall evaluation. You have much more time (impression). The emotional could be badly placed. A year where it is necessary to purify instead of undertaking new things. Content yourself to reflect on new things for next year. Can be a positive or negative year depending on the previous 8 years.
		- This year finishes the 9 year cycle. It is synonymous with review but it also offers a perspective on a future way of life, in preparation of starting the cycle again. It depends a lot on what you have lived and sown in the past, what you still need to achieve and aspects of life that you must consider from a different angle. A concluding and enriching year, with success or to the contrary with sorrow, losses, upheaval, suffering. A year to settle problems where it is not worth starting medium or long-term projects. This is a very useful period in which to find your bearings, evaluate the present, and make sound resolutions for the future. Later, after having cleaned up your personal file, you must think once again of the changes that you would like to see happen in your life and then prepare for next start (Personal Year Number 1). It is therefore, a period charged with emotion, where joy or depression can easily follow. You need to be frank and have a real will-power to be able to use the favorable vibrations that accompany the number 9 and free yourself from all that is negative.
		- On the financial side of things, it is possible to reap the harvest, due to your efforts and intuitions in the previous years. Sales are generally profitable, but not new investments. Be careful ! You risk so much to win easily as well as you could lose pitifully. Think about the capital that will perhaps be necessary for year 1. If you must invest, wait for the last three months of this year or the beginning of the following year. Professionally you will have the chance to achieve passed projects or make a clean sweep of elements that have become unsuitable. Successes are expected at work if it is concerned with the public (professions linked to publicity, the media in general, or certain large scale commercial activities).
		  Turn yourself towards all that is light, life, altruism and elevation. Banish all the little egoistic elements and ulterior motives. Learn to give for the pleasure of giving. Prepare yourself for a sort of purification- renewal in getting rid of immature emotions and reactions, negative or nasty thoughts and any other habits you have that are restricting your blossoming (of course this only applies to those that are not yet perfect).
		- It a favorable period to meet people coming from different horizons. This will allow you to freshen your concepts or even break ties with those who you consider to have a bad influence on you. Sometimes these bonds that imprison you are so subtle that you might not have been aware of them before. If you have the opportunity and the means to travel abroad, jump at the chance to change your surroundings. Let yourself be carried by your desires for discoveries and understanding different ways of life. However, before you leave try to conclude unfinished business or change unsatisfactory associations. Then you can leave completely carefree.
		- Love life
		- This is a year of completion with the possibility of either full-bloom or the necessity to make adjustments according to how things went during the previous 8 years. However it is not necessary to look at these adjustments negatively, it is better to look at their saving aspects which offer you the chance to start the cycle again from a sound base. New contacts can sometimes create a beneficial open-mindedness for you. On the emotional side, you will be a little distant. It will be necessary for your partner to show [his,her] spiritual elegance, to have any hope of seducing you. Pettiness such as materialism and excessive preoccupation with housework (or mundane things) would trigger off an unconscious rejection.
		- However, all this is relative to your Key number (the day and month of birth added together and then reduced to a number between 1 and 9. For example 12 + 9 = 21 = 3).
		- Key 1 : Little change for single people. Couples must prove their improved sensitivity and originality to live this year harmoniously.
		  Key 2 : Conflicts in view. Be vigilant, do not make decisions for the moment.
		  Key 3 : It is worth starting from sound bases rather than trying to cling on to a relationship that has lost it's spark (or a person who is no longer interested). So the relationship of those people in a couple can bloom. No real prospects for single people.
		  Key 4 : Emotional fragility and even temptation this year. You need to cool your ideas down a little or you are going to meet frustrations and disappointments.
		  Key 5 : A great emotional demand with risks of becoming a bit fragile. As for people living as a couple, you will think about reinforcing your union.
		  Key 6 : Some tensions that will necessitate a serious discussion (couples) but without raising tone. A meeting that will excite you, but things will not happen as quickly as you would like. Keep your feet on solid ground.
		  Key 7 : Little change for single people. Those in couples could question the relationship and be tempted to look elsewhere. It is not a good idea, rather be patient. Do not become morose or underhand.
		  Key 8 : Rather an unfavorable period.
		  Key 9 : Quite a laborious year with dissatisfactions. Your situation (married or not) will not suit you any more. You have a deep need for something new, fresh and to get to know other types of personality.
		  Health
		- A tendency to feel tired (except Key 5). Possible problems for those who are afraid of illness and who are a bit depressed. It is in your interest to care about purification and rest, to have healthy habits, also in the emotional and physical areas. Listen to your intuition. It is a good moment for a health check-up and to rid yourself of any little problems . New medical treatments should be postponed if possible.
		- If year 9 was arrived at via 27 (vertical addition then reduction), the year is more favorable for you in principle than if your 9 came from an 18. Then it will be a confusing year, with poor visibility that won't make work of overall evaluation and "cleaning" easy. In a general way, don't lose sight of reality, don't let situations drag on.
		- #11
		  Your Personal Year Number is 11. Inspiration, awakening, intuition.
		- Vibrations of this type (as all other master numbers) are stronger. Usually people live this period one octave or level beneath, that is as in year 2 whose interpretation follows. More sensitive people can live this period partially in the way of an 11. If this is the case for you, your mind will be more awakened and your consciousness more refined. You have increased energy in these areas and this can give you influence over others. Make the most of a year of growth to raise your level of consciousness. It is an ideal period to develop your talents, to use your intelligence and inspiration in such areas as ideas, literature, the media, religion, invention, the arts etc.. Let others benefit from your awakening and ideals, but avoid getting into fanaticism. Year 11 doesn't suit everybody. It is necessary to have an inner force and stability as well as a good capacity to relax because this vibration can bring nervousness and irritability. A fundamental difference between years 2 and 11 concerns decision making. Someone living through the number 2 vibration will be a lot more passive, being carried along by events, rather than using [his,her] intuition to take the initiative. That is why the year 11 is generally seen as fruitful, dynamic, and supportive.
		- Your Personal Year Number is 2. Cooperation, sensitivity.
		- Summary : The time to perfect previous experiences. It is necessary to co-operate with others and fetch their help too. It is the time to consider the small details, to save up money or to get married. Duality in relationships. Some friends, but do not be too confident in them.
		- In a general way, it is the period where we cultivate what has been sown in the previous year. This number 2 vibration is feminine (Yin). It is going to influence or put an accent on co-operation and relationships with others. This will be a time for friends, helping others, love, marriage. On the negative side, divorce for those who refuse to live in harmony with this vibration (harmony or conflict, the calm sea or the wild ocean, according also to last years behavior). Emotions have a lot of importance this year as well as sensitivity, perfectionism and women in a general sort of way. It is a matter of using this vibration intelligently, that is, to strengthen last year undertakings but also not to leave oneself overflowing with emotional things. The emotions arrive at just the right time to shape your previous year's projects. If year number 1 helped you give birth to new ideas, to make decisions, to express your individuality then this year will help supplement these achievements, as a sort of welcome sedimentation. On the other hand, this year can bring out the passive, indecisive side in you or just test you for the resistances you had in year one, but this time emotionally.
		- Professional life
		- After the awakening of last year you have probably started some sort of project(s). To make these successful you must now work to perfect any little details still outstanding because these will be the cause of the final success or failure of the project. Try not to be rigid or impatient, do not hang on obstinately to the mental sketches or plan that you made last year. Know how to adapt. It will be necessary to change things a little, maybe to withdraw in order to look to others and be inspired by their ideas. Leave things to come to you to a certain extent, because co-operation, listening and consolidation are the key words this year. See the people that can help you, make your relationships more relaxed. Last year you had to advance alone, find your independence. This year needs teamwork rather than independence, there are new people to meet, collaborations, contracts. You could find a new job. But try not to let yourself become blindly confident, with a lack of objectivity, because it will make you vulnerable especially with important associates (implicating money). Try to keep yourself in a positive environment. Be careful to avoid doubting yourself and just giving up, because this year will test you in this respect.
		- Love life
		- This year is placed under the sign of duality. Love affairs, marriage, agreements but also a possibility of conflicts, criticism or divorce (according to the way you live this vibration). Nevertheless, this is a generally positive period and you can count on good relationships with women or people endowed with kindness. The number 2 vibration gives out intuition, receptivity and availability. Listen well to your own inspirations and don't hesitate to cultivate this sensitivity. Accept background roles during this period, it will allow you to prepare and strengthen yourself for what follows. It is often better to stand back slightly before jumping. It is worth knowing that this year is quite capable of turning gossips and critics against you. It is not worth wasting your time on trying to understand why, it is just a part of your emotional lesson on balance. Show your indifference and it will stop. Sterile disputes don't put you on the road of advancement, in fact quite to the contrary. Try to be relaxed and friendly this year, be tactful and avoid interfering with those who do not concern you.
		- For women, year number 2 can awaken unconscious conflicts linked with feminine polarity (female relationships, mother, sister, one's own femininity, social status or romantic love). If there is an underlying emotional disagreement of this type, it is highly probable that it will be intensified. Thus, you can find yourself in situations that will cause this problem to arise again, which will help you to understand the emotional block better and so allow you to overcome it. Don't try to dodge it, be honest with yourself. It is a matter of maturing and blossoming (with your emotional expression), not to leave yourself submerged by silly emotions or to bury feelings deeper due to environmental pressures. For men, the awakening of this feminine energy can be disconcerting for those who are not used to expressing emotions, those who keep that sort of thing hidden. In fact, it is particularly beneficial for men (contrary to general belief) to have to put up with such things as intuition and sensitivity. It can only make things better. Even World Champions lean on qualities said to be feminine.
		- However, all this is relative to your Key number (the day and month of birth added together and then reduced to a number between 1 and 9. For example 12 + 9 = 21 = 3).
		- Key 1 : Good emotional balance for single people. Meetings possible during the second half of the year. Not a very eventful period for couples.
		  Key 2 : A relatively favorable period.
		  Key 3 : A very emotional period (affections). Some quite intense meetings for the unattached, who want to find their kindred spirit. Nothing guaranteed however, concerning the duration of these relationships, particularly those that started during July, August or September. Some small crises for couples. The success of this year is linked to a certain extent to how good you are at making up and your ability to be tender.
		  Key 4 : If there is a mutual understanding, the old problems must find a solution due to a new conception of your relationship based on tact and mutual respect. Be vigilant, particularly at the end of the year.
		  Key 5 : A rather glorious and exalting time waits for you. Highs and lows, with a positive end to the year for those who are single ; some setbacks for those couples who are not endowed with a lot of tact and understanding of each other.
		  Key 6 : Except for the end of the year, this year is a favorable time for marriage. The end of the year finds you wanting to be alone.
		  Key 7 : The first three-quarters of this year will be disappointing, but don't become disheartened because the end of the year will be very positive with long term repercussions.
		  Key 8 : A very favorable climate. Single people will find someone to suit them, even if the romantic side of things stay a little in background.
		  Key 9 : Some disappointments for the single people and doubts for the couples. Be very patient, do not abandon your dream.
		  Health
		- Your emotional unbalance will be your weak point. A possible excess of sensitivity. Fix certain limits for yourself and do not cross them. Relax, do some sport. Do not let yourself spend too much time on thinking about internal tensions, that can put pressure on the digestive system (and eventually lead to surgical intervention years later if it turns into an obsession). Think about healthy drinking. Give your body a helping hand with a course of vitamins and minerals. Reduce your intake of animal fats by choosing to use non refined and non hydrogenated vegetable oils.
		- #22
		  Your Personal Year Number is 22. Creative inspiration.
		- It is rare to live a complete year fully in the way of the 22. Often the vibrations of this year correspond to those of year 4 or a higher caliber of year 4.
		- The vibrations of the year 22 are very close to the 11 also, the difference is that the 22 allows more creativity and material power. It puts into practice inspired ideas. The forces of a real year 22 will be positive for those with a high status, a high commitment into large achievement or invention but above all working with the interest of humanity (even indirectly). Such a vibration isn't suitable for people with egoistic or skimpy views or for people that don't have the sufficient caliber. Nervous tensions would be even stronger than in year 11 ! Year 22 requires good health and regular rest because overwork is frequent.
		- Most of the time people will live this year mostly like the 4 and partly like the 22. More energy will be at your disposal so it's up to you to convert it into successful achievement. It can be within the realm of construction, invention, large scale organization or linked to the foreign. Don't have egoistic aims. If you are too self-centered, you risk slipping very quickly, being very tense and having internal conflicts. Use this 22/4 vibration correctly and you will be amazed !
		- Your Personal Year Number is 4. Stabilization, work, rigor.
		- Summary : The year of effort and seriousness. Construction for the future. Possible hardship. Tiredness. The first harvest or the first bill according to your behavior in the last few years. Not much time for pleasures.
		- After a year of joy and expression, material contingencies demand your attention. This vibration is going to place importance on work. Try to take pleasure in this area, rather than going against the current flow with it, because if you fight this vibration, it will only increase the risk of mad surprises or limitations. Thus this period is one of the construction of solid bases and effort. Do not neglect the small details, your construction must be made to last. It is the last year of the 9 years cycle to install your bases (from the first year when you made the sketches).
		- A surplus of courage would be useful here because the risk is that the work will be long-term and you will have to prove your perseverance. It is your affairs, your work, your house (as far as the upkeep goes) that are important this year. Keep an eye on them. Your success will be a result of your constancy and tenacity. Be orderly, methodical and practical. Help others. Do not let yourself go during this period.
		- If difficulties, struggles and shortages must have their place somewhere, it is generally during year 4. It is your perseverance, your logical mind and your forethought (due to what you are reading now) that will see you through it. Face your obligations. Be as honest, loyal and stable as possible. Be patient with delays and limitations. Avoid being tempted to start new projects, it is not a good time.
		- Some people can live this vibration by working on themselves ; allowing themselves progression and internal purification. In it's negative form, this vibration can reveal an underlying conflict linked to work. For example, the children could feel abandoned and unconsciously chose an indirect way to make you aware of it. You could even feel guilty or uncomfortable with working too hard and this is because you have already experienced it with your parents spending their time working when you were a child.
		- Love life
		- This is the moment to stabilize your love life and to think of building a future. It is not especially a good year to start new things ; you could even have to face a waiting period when it comes to unifying projects. It is possible that you will experience certain problems when it comes to expressing emotions. You could just feel a little cramped. Try not to get too annoyed with others. Do not show that you are not satisfied with them. Advice for partners : show your reliable, serious side. Be aware that someone experiencing year 4 needs tangible signs of reassurance.
		- However, all this is relative to your Key number (the day and month of birth added together and then reduced to a number between 1 and 9. For example 12 + 9 = 21 = 3).
		  Key 1 : This vibration is favorable to those who live as part of a couple, because they will strengthen their bond. It is not a good year for new relationships.
		  Key 2 : Single people with this Key number are certainly going to have a great moment in their emotional life with a solid relationship looking towards a harmonious future for a number of years. Couples will end up by becoming closer and reinforcing their agreement for the future.
		  Key 3 : Disappointments until the Autumn. You will be perturbed. But there will be a change for the better at the end of the year for couples and especially for single people who will have the chance to enter into a new, long- lasting relationship (over 12 years), provided that your partner is in Personal Year 2 or 6.
		  Key 4 : A mixed year. At the start you lose confidence in yourself, but you finish the year strengthened because you will have taken the time to resolve your problems or thanks to a new friendship (especially single people).
		  Key 5 : Your interest will be focused on your professional or family activities. The accent is on seriousness. In your emotional life it is the strength of the bond between you and your pattern that will be important for you. Existing friends and lovers will benefit from this tendency. For single people, the birth of a relationship is possible at the end of the year. If a relationship does materialize, it will last quite a long time (certainly over 12 years).
		  Key 6 : Couples will come to realize what an argument really is during the first six months of this year, and they will be over little things. It is important for you to make sure that your partner respect you and understand your expectations without having to raise your voice ! Happily, things change for the better. Single people : burdensome solitude for the first three months, followed by a very happy period (July to December) as it is probable that you will meet someone who changes your life.
		  Key 7 : A very good period for those who live in a couple. The emotional climate is a bit more dull for the others. Perhaps a new friendship in the second half of the year, but it is fragile. It is up to you to decide whether you would like to maintain it for the future.
		  Key 8 : Disappointment and solitude for the single people, but there are always exceptions to the rule. There are tensions for the couples whose relationship lacks frankness, fervor or depth. It will be necessary for you to think about larger issues than mundane routines if you want to make it through. There is a risk of break-up during July, August and September. Simple friendships will be favored for everyone this year.
		  Key 9 : A very positive meeting for those who are generally pleasant, and a rather negative one for the others (at the end of the year). It is a similar situation for couples. However, it is worth avoiding divorce this year, it is not the good moment.
		  Health
		- Keep watch on your health this year. You could suffer from over-work and see your existing problems intensify. Notably tiredness, joint problems or bone problems, skin, teeth (especially night bruxism if you are anxious). Breath properly, relax your body and mind. Take things as they come, do not force things, because you will not get very far like that.
		- #33
		  Your Personal Year Number is 33. Tolerance, sacrifice, interest for humanity.
		- It is very rare that this strong vibration makes itself felt on the level of a Personal Year Number. This will more likely be a number 6. The year 33 can imply a sort of sacrifice or abnegation for the good of the community, an inspiration used to communicate with others and to guide them with the aim of protecting them and looking after them. It is a period of wisdom and evolution. You can partially find these notions in the year number 6.
		- Your Personal Year Number is 6. Harmony, responsibility.
		- Summary : Your surroundings are going to become your main interest (family, house, comfort, decoration, well-being, marriage). More family or professional responsibilities. Investments and money matters are favored.
		- After a perhaps carefree year, often rich in movement and change, the accent will now be on one or several of the following areas : family, marriage, family life, private and professional responsibilities, finances, devotion or sacrifice, obligations, the search for harmony and stability, as well as solving personal problems (often to do with love). If it seems to be a positive year, you will have the opportunity for promotion. Otherwise responsibilities will be harder to manage, rather intrusive than desired. For example, the people around you could encroach upon your territory and try to get something from you. The children could be painful. The house could need repairing and new responsibilities could also come to overload your shoulders. However, you need not become morose. This period is supposed to bring out your sense of being helpful and capacity to spread harmony. Do not let yourself be dominated, submerged by your environment. Play the game, but in taking the wheel. So do not let yourself suffer or be exploited. It will probably be necessary for you to show your devotion to duty, to adapt and to give without necessarily being thanked. Try to keep the happy medium, don't feel sorry for yourself and this period will bring satisfaction. It is a phase where it is worth spreading harmony and resolving the crises (gently but firmly) rather than aggravating them.
		- Professional life
		- The year 6 is one of the family and it's shelter. It will be favorable for investments especially for everything that concerns the home, interior decoration and comfort. If you possess an artistic talent, this year will support it because vibration 6 is also one of the aesthetic and harmony. The grip of responsibilities can also be linked to a promotion at work or a modification of the nature of your work. You will have some choices to make. Others will come to you for advice. A favorable year for commerce linked to body care (including products) and fitness etc...
		- Love life
		- You will feel a stronger emotional demand than usual. You will need to be understood, you will search for more security or sympathy from those around you. If it is normal in this period to appear obliging to others, it will not be necessary to be too much so especially when it comes to interfering into other peoples business.
		- Love, romance, tolerance and the sense of conciliation are the strong aspects of the number 6 vibration. It can carry with it opposing situations : a quiet year, a marriage but also the return of old problems, a threat of divorce because it is going to place a lot of importance on your love relationships and therefore test them to enable you to renew them or make them stronger. Once the irritating attitudes of everyone are subdued or changed, you can start again from a better basis. If you are single, this year will stimulate your desire to find a companion or spouse. A very important meeting (for your love life) could happen without you having been on the look out. If there are under-lying tensions in your couple, there is a strong chance that they will become worse in order for you to be able to understand (calmly) the causes and how to resolve them. Success is within your reach. All you have to do is to use the conciliating and pacific vibrations that are at your disposal. Do not hesitate to give a bit more tenderness, take pleasure in doing little things for others. Sow the seeds and you will reap the harvest. Your need for profound communication will intensify. When we flow with the rhythm of this vibration, we need to be more reassured (in love relationships) and coaxed. But we are fragile if treated coldly or harshly. This need of harmony and human warmth must not make you become over emotional, in a sort of avoidance of reality. This is a possible tendency if your personal numbers are already linked to the number 6. Look at situations soundly and clearly.
		- However, all this is relative to your Key number (the day and month of birth added together and then reduced to a number between 1 and 9. For example 12 + 9 = 21 = 3).
		- Key 1 : A year that is finally pleasant and beneficial for those that are still single. Married people must keep their calm during April, May and June.
		  Key 2 : A very good year for single people, in particular from October onwards. Some frictions during the summer for married people. A little more attention and all will return to normal.
		  Key 3 : An occasion to find the ideal person will be on offer to single people. It will be necessary to be ready and to know how to identify [him,her]. Couples will live in harmony, except perhaps during the summer due to unexpected events.
		  Key 4 : You will concentrate all of your attention on your new partner or existing one, to the point of neglecting your other activities a little.
		  Key 5 : Your emotional life will bloom.
		  Key 6 : A pleasant atmosphere. Favorable for unions.
		  Key 7 : A very romantic atmosphere for single people who will easily find their ideal partner. A long-term relationship in view. A good atmosphere for married people, who will look to deepen their mutual understanding and put more value on their life as a couple.
		  Key 8 : An important and long-lasting meeting for single people. Marriage is favorable during second half of the year. Family projects (improvement of surroundings, a new baby). A good year.
		  Key 9 : Good fortune for single people with a long-lasting commitment (highly possible). A risk of a break down for married people during April, May or June. Moderate the atmosphere. For everyone, new friendships will be healthy and enriching.
		  Please note that if your Personal Year Number 6 came from a 15 (after the vertical addition and reduction of the total), the sensuality and non-verbal communication will be at front stage. If the 6 came from 33, the accent will be more on responsibilities. If it came from the number 24, it will be necessary to overcome certain difficulties, especially to do with love.
		- Health
		- A weakening due to overwork. Possible urinary related problems, accumulated toxins, bone related problems and tensions caused by stress. They are the physical effects of your psychological folding under the weight of responsibility. Be careful not to allow your problems to get on top of you ! Don't stock them in yourself ! Do not look for compensation of your emotional problems in chocolate and sugary things.

		- Numerology
		  & The Challenges of Life
		- The 3 Challenges of your life allow the discovery of the key attitudes that you are advised to adopt, if you want your life to be successful and have the satisfaction of overcoming the obstacles that can stand in your way. The information that gives you these Challenges is therefore worth all your attention.
		- It can help you take control over your own life and live more serenely.
		- Three Challenges exist :
		- The first one is concerned with your life up until the age of 36-40 ; if you surmount it, it's influence will be subsequently softened afterwards.
		- The second Challenge starts around the age of 40 and is concerned with the second phase of your life.
		- The third Challenge is called the major Challenge because it will apply throughout your life but it's importance is lower.
		- To calculate your Challenges, first reduce your day, month and year of birth.
		  Challenge 1 : the reduced difference between the day and the month.
		  concerns the life till 36 - 40 years
		- Challenge 2 : the reduced difference between the day and the year.
		  starting at 40.
		- Major Challenge : difference between Challenge 1 and 2.
		  concerns all life
		- If your three Challenges are zeros, then the first Challenge is the difference between the first and last vowel of your full name ; the second Challenge uses the consonants (still a difference); the major Challenge is the addition (not a difference) of the first and second Challenge.
		- The 3 Challenges of your life
		- The first challenge is the difference between the day and the month ; the second challenge is the difference between the month and the year ; the major challenge is the difference between the first and second challenge. Here is what they mean by number:
		- #0
		  If your number is 0, you haven't got a challenge to take up. This underlines the importance of your free-will in this area of your life.
		- #1
		  You have a number 1 challenge. The 1 symbolizes originality, independence, individuality, self-confidence and commencement. This challenge rightly asks you to cultivate these qualities. You must be an original and self-confident person of who you admire and would like to know. As it were, a sun in the life of the others around you and around which all revolves (and which lavishes heat and light). You must be the one who knows how to give, to break new ground, to conquer and to have good ideas. Once you have this strong, shining personality, that you are master of yourself, the danger that is lying in wait for you is falling to the excess of authoritarianism and lacking respect for others. So, it will be necessary to adopt a balanced attitude if you want to blossom well.
		- #2
		  You have a number 2 challenge. It must be confessed that this is a difficult challenge. Destiny will place you in situations where you will regularly be confronted by authority or hierarchical systems (parents, teachers, bosses, public power) that are unjust and even tyrannical. Not really the conciliating, pleasant and intelligent world that you would wish for. However, it is going to be necessary to play the game and win it. How ? Certainly not in having the emotional reaction of running away, revolting or being passive. If you don't face it now you certainly have to face it later. The good solution consist in awakening the part of yourself that will take pleasure in tackling these problems with shrewdness, good-manners, diplomacy, co-operation and above all intelligence. In this way, graced with your developed relational sense, your subtlety and your logic you will be able to manipulate the authority in question. Once this challenge has been taken up, you will be in step to transform the hierarchical situations or the more arduous relations to your advantage, so much and so well that instead of irritating you, the manifestations of authority will amuse you and even delight you.
		- #3
		  You have a number 3 challenge. Providence has placed deep within you, a certain number of treasures, which are talents of expression and creative qualities. The aim of this challenge consists in awakening and exploiting these talents which are unused so far. Express what you feel, externalize your inner richness. Don't be afraid to change and to make an effort with yourself if necessary. These talents, this creativity exist, it is up to you to show their value. Take no notice of possible complexes or hang-ups. Whether it's a matter of literary talents, oral, artistic, intellectual, creative or simply the joy of living, you have something to express ! Be conscious of this and don't ruin this potential. Be at ease with yourself ; go and look for the little marvels that are just waiting to hatch. If you don't play the game of this challenge, you will have limitations and obstacles until you understand that it isn't outside but inside yourself that you can find all the keys and riches which will adorn your life. Once this challenge has been overcome you must be careful not to fall into the excesses of externalization that is : extravagance and the need to be the center of attention all of the time.
		- #4
		  You have a number 4 challenge. The 4 symbolizes stability, balance, solid foundations of existence. These are the 4 walls that support the roof of a house or the 4 legs of a chair. This challenge will give you numerous occasions in which to strengthen your personal base. As long as you don't establish a solid, serious base, there will be no path to suit you. The obstacles that will appear on your route, the attempts at destabilization that you will meet will only be occasions that life will offer you, in order to spur you on in the path of stabilization. You must awaken in yourself the faculties of balance, precision, honesty and stability. You will be called very early to organize yourself well, to structure yourself, to learn to construct your supports with regularity and above all systematically. In effect, if you start to neglect the details, problems will appear in your emotional and professional life. Don't be tempted to flee from your environment or always look elsewhere. Don't try to take yourself away from your challenge. Stand up to it here and now, step after step, without haste. Once that you have found the rhythm it will be necessary to avoid certain excesses : an imprisonment within work or a lack of ability to put separates ideas into a whole.
		- #5
		  You have a number 5 challenge. The number 5 symbolizes expansion, energy, and experiences. So, this challenge is going to ask you to learn to manage your free-will in a healthy way in all your activities. You are going to be confronted with multiple experiences and numerous changes that will allow you to decide how to use your freedom, your abundant energy, your senses and your passions. Sometimes you will have serious losses of motivation, but it will be necessary to find it again. You will be lead to surpass yourself physically, intellectually and even spiritually and this will demand a good ability to adapt. You will certainly live some phases excessively when it comes to curiosity, taking risks, greed, sexuality or even drink ; sometimes interspersed with short periods where you will try to recapture yourself in imposing rules on yourself which are a lot more strict and come very close to asceticism or self-punishment. The object of the number 5 challenge is to make the necessity for you to establish a healthy balance in your life style evident and not to make you a slave to your experiences and way of life. In this way you will succeed as a master of your senses and vitality. You will have a greater understanding of the things in life, so much so that your rich experience will make you an appreciated "teacher of life".
		- #6
		  You have a number 6 challenge. This challenge is related to the power to harmonize. It applies itself to family concepts, generosity, listening, love, agreement with others as well as with yourself. With such a challenge you risk having a lack of harmony in your environment which you must put right. Destiny could for example, make you live through situations where you will be disappointed by those around you, your friends or your professional colleagues. Perhaps you must face a lack of authenticity, fidelity, tact, attitudes without nobility or disagreeable remarks. Rather than getting shaken up and perhaps adopting such bad habits yourself (falling unfortunately from your tower), this challenge asks you to disregard the imperfections of those around you and make good use of your ability to create harmony around yourself. Learn to be an example of harmony in all areas. Learn to forgive the errors of the others, stop judging them badly. It is obviously a difficult challenge to take up which demands a great force of character and a good aura. Perhaps admitting that the world isn't yet perfect and that the people are still immature, will help you live through these situations more serenely and master them. This challenge will also be able to test your capacity to reign over harmony and tenderness in your emotional life. Therefore, you must think about marriage seriously before you go ahead. You better have to establish good rules of communication in this perspective. The objective of your challenge is to incite you to manage your enterprises well in spite of possible disharmonies, to go after your engagements, to assume your responsibilities, but also to moderate your requirements and to listen to others (especially those close to you). The objective being the establishment of a pleasant atmosphere favoring communication, conciliation, aid and advise.
		- #7
		  You have a number 7 challenge. This is a very special challenge ! It commands you to grace introspection, reflection, inspiration and good sense to find in you solutions and an attitude that make you able to surpass the obstacles that appear on your route. Note that it is a matter of a good attitude and approach more than external actions ! Destiny will not miss confronting you with people and situations that put you in a position of challenge, to compel you sooner or later to show your boldness, determination, self-discipline and above all to appeal to your personal abilities (already known or as yet unused). For this, you must have faith in an inner power that will help you to overcome these obstacles and achieve the real "feats of strength". In fact, you have better aptitudes than you think ; simply to manage well the things that you start you must look inside yourself (rather than outside) for the solutions and the ability. In not being afraid to play the game of the challenge, in other words resolving step by step the difficulties you may encounter, you will slowly develop a better communication with your inner guide and in this way reach new personal possibilities. It is imperative that you avoid intellectual dispersion, a lack of calm or concentration. Try to adopt an attitude more centered on authenticity, and simplicity rather than pride. The impression that you create on others will be largely beneficial. This challenge incites you to become the perfect self-taught person capable of achieving great things. The best way to reach this self-confidence and know-how is to take up the challenges, to clear the obstacle and not back away.
		- #8
		  You have a number 8 challenge. This challenge consists in mastering the power (money or power) and the knowledge to use it well. This is why during your life you will be confronted by money, talents, power and ambition. You must learn to conquer these areas or manage them intelligently if destiny has been generous with you. In particular, you must learn to respect the value of money and power. That means using it in the right way. Riches and power often have the same effect as alcohol : they quickly go to the head. The objective of this challenge is to find a balance between too much and too little, which could drive you towards the path of arrogance, excessive materialism, unscrupulous ambition and sometimes wastefulness and ruin. Don't under-value the money that you have earn by unconsidered spending. Too little if you evade the necessity to enrich yourself well, succeeding materially or if you give up or let things go. Above all, be careful of the intoxication of this power. You are only the administrator, good or bad. Thus, it will be necessary to discipline yourself because with this number 8 vibration nothing is definitely stable. You must stay vigilant. On the other hand, you mustn't neglect the money and power to the point of rejecting them, because destiny will continue to chase after you in this area. Don't feel sorry for yourself, because after all this challenge pushes towards success. The best means of making it consist in managing the material and spiritual life together, keeping control and good sense in these two key areas.
		- #9
		  You have a number 9 challenge. It is a noble but sometimes difficult challenge to take up. It necessitates a good dose of altruism on your part. In effect, you will be brought to benefit those around you and your family a part of your time, your know-how or your willingness without grimacing. If you are capable of sacrificing yourself for the happiness of others by pure pleasure, then you have understood everything. However, if you choose the path of egoism, life could put you in situations where you will have to make unwilling sacrifices. In this way you could be brought to look after a younger brother or sister or a person which you don't care about. Your professional activity could steer you towards an area which you don't like or with people who find it hard to tolerate you.
		- Obviously it isn't good to be discontented all time and you will not be unburden with this problem in adopting a negative attitude of refusal. It would be better to change your behavior as early as possible in order to use positively this challenge and not to suffer troubles. Make the first move and choose to devote yourself to good actions in giving the best of yourself until you can naturally take pleasure in giving, in making concessions for the happiness of others and not to just satisfy your ego. It is a matter of being sensitive to the more noble human ideas and emotions (sensitivity, compassion, helping others, the sense of beauty, purity, tolerance, panache, nobility....). When this challenge has been overcome, a sort of sublimation often occurs which will positively transform your existence and fill you with happiness, openness and success. The excess that you must avoid : forgetting yourself and neglect your own balance due to turning too much towards others.

It is during childhood that one can change habits to create a balanced adult.

		- You are in a number 4 Pinnacle. Not a very favorable period. Being carefree is not welcome. This vibration demands efforts. It is necessary to understand early the necessity of work and obligations. Apprenticeship for the benefit of discipline and perseverance is indispensable. Obviously, it is not always in this way that we can imagine childhood, but it will serve the rest of the life well. There will not really be financial ease, much imagination or leisure activity ; rather practical work. Finally, we will find you to be reliable, responsible and courageous. If your number 4 came from a 13, there is likely to be a transformation. Not always easy, but necessary.

But make sure that you stand back a bit when it is a matter of taking a decision. Ultimately, your efforts during these 9 years will be repaid and others will respect your worth. Amusements and leisure activities will happen on a secondary level. Financially, don't take risks, stick to traditional saving methods.
		- This Pinnacle necessitates a specific apprenticeship and makes up part of the challenges of your life. Not everyone is comfortable with organization and steady work. However, as your life is within this vibration, you must learn to find the good points, otherwise you risk having to put up with annoyances of a vibration 4 !.

		- You are in a number 4 Pinnacle. Lots of work and energy to continue to build. It is probable that you will not be especially fortunate when it comes to material and financial protection, but you will keep fighting. You will have the tendency to identify yourself with your professional activity. In your mind the word retirement can be associated with being out of the running (inactivity) and you refuse it. It is good, but don't go to the other extreme, because to exhaust yourself with work or to center your confidence and self-respect entirely on your professional life is not always a good strategy. Don't put all your eggs in one basket !

		- You are in a number 5 Pinnacle. Despite appearances, this period is excellent for the growth of a child or adolescent. It is perhaps not entirely in tune with the traditional educational system which is quite heavy or not always adapted to real life. Discipline, regularity and consistence may be weak points, undoubtedly to improve, but above all it will be necessary to use intelligently qualities (specific to vibration 5) such as curiosity, vitality and open-mindedness. So parents should complement their child's education, so as not to leave it entirely in the hands of an national educational system that does not cover all essential areas. Your child needs to play some sport, to participate in discovery activities, to have an open environment (with certain barriers to contain the excesses) to allow this young person the freedom to have [his,her] own experiences and to become versatile. If the number 5 is in excess of [his,her] theme, it will be necessary to put [him,her] back in the right place (and explain why), and set limits in order to prevent all the extravagances that are to be feared with a number 5. Understand that your child will want to take risks out of curiosity but also to prove [his,her] personal freedom. Don't blame the child, instead try to teach the advantages of good sense and the rules of "vital minimum security".

Your energy needs to be used, so learn to steer it in the right direction. Try to live in harmony with this vibration that life has imposed on you, in respecting the good beat.

		- You are in a number 6 Pinnacle. This period is going to be bathed in tenderness. This emotional heat (often maternal) if it isn't too heavy or invading can be a good catalyst for artistic sensitivity and adolescent creativity. In spite of this comfortable and harmonious environment, it can happen that the person is lead to take on important responsibilities at quite a young age (looking after a younger brother or sister, taking on family burdens too early). If it is a matter of a conciliatory person (see the rest of the theme) who likes to give [his,her] time and who is generous with humane warmth, then it won't be difficult. Otherwise these obligations will be a constraint and will be badly lived with. The number 6 vibration, being also one of love and marriage, can lead to marriage at quite a young age. In this case, it is necessary to be sure that it is a good choice rather than a choice due to the need to have someone, being too sentimental, or to try to escape from family constraints.

This vibration placed in this cycle of achievement is destined to aid practical applications of the warmth and sensibility of the 6 for example in the artistic creativity. In a certain way, financial activities (especially those linked to the home, architecture and interior decoration), ecology, everything that is linked to the arts, selling luxury and body products as well as dietary will be favored. If the number 6 plays a large part in your theme, it will be necessary to make more independent choices and not become hesitant so as not to hurt other peoples feelings (or because you are afraid what others might say). At the opposite, a total absence of the number 6 can be synonymous to tense relationships (especially between couples) with the obligation to learn to be more reconciling in order to vibrate in harmony with your Pinnacle vibration.

		- #7/1
		  Pinnacles with the value of 7
		- Quite a delicate period to explain, in the sense that your concrete achievements will be orientated towards an area of activity linked to introspection, reflection and intellectual work, therefore they will be difficult to see. Your area could be studying, research, writing or simply working on yourself. It is quite a calm period, studious where one has the tendency to be isolated (from time to time to take time out or observe). It is certainly a serious phase, favorable to personal progress or the realization of your intellectual work but less in things that concern others, especially relationships, emotions and pleasures. A union built during these years is not always easy unless other vibrations in the Life Cycle favor it. If this cycle of achievement disorientates you because of the incompatibility with your principal numbers, don't panic ; calmly make your inner discoveries and keep your feet on the ground.
		- You are in a number 7 Pinnacle. The vibration 7 gives a very rich inner world. It favors study, above all in specialized areas. However, the blooming of the adolescent emotions and physique will not benefit a great deal (a risk of solitary behavior or timidity more or less accentuated according to the rest of the theme). This unsynchronized tendency with usual childhood can eventually lead to incomprehension on the part of others, including those who would like to help and therefore, an inner suffering. This vibration placed in this cycle of achievement is destined to aid practical applications of observation and semantic reflection. Eventually it can help you to take the time to find self-confidence and clarity in order to tackle life better. So, it is a matter of working on yourself and not to throw yourself into the arms of the first attractive theory. Parents should be patient and instill solid bases and a good sense of balance. Finally, you will have someone intelligent and conceptual, but with the feet on the ground.

		- You are in a number 7 Pinnacle. This period that favors reflection offers you the occasion to study, to become intellectually richer in the aims of using these qualities for concrete achievements. You can take this offer up in the areas of writing (a book for example), journalism, teaching, research or the improvement of your strategy with regard to your activities. In a general way, all achievement that appeals to intellectual and conceptual affluence, the talents of observation, analysis or intuition. Obviously, it is not so easy for all that concerns life's pleasures, love or domestic tasks. But this is not a pretext under which to neglect these areas and fall behind. Just keep in mind that there is a time for reflection, a time for blossoming, a time for work, etc. Of course in using all these different periods intelligently.

		- You are in a number 7 Pinnacle. A studious and perhaps solitary period. It is not always easy to tackle, particularly if nothing in your theme has prepared you for it. On the other hand, the specialists of study risk forgetting to lighten their heart, body and ultimately their mind by insisting on keeping their head buried in the books. Don't forget to experience the things around you. If lived through well, this period can bring you it's share of satisfactions. It's up to you to get organized !
		- #8/1
		  Pinnacles with the value of 8
		- This vibration placed in this cycle of achievement is destined to aid practical applications of the typical qualities of the 8 (courage, energy, ambition, determination, clear-headedness,...). The activities of these periods mainly concern money, business, competition and the power or confrontations that accompany money and business, material and general success. Badly received, this vibration can bring two types of problem. Worries, difficulties in succeeding (the 8 means that you should never give up in order to master things). Highs and lows, brutal losses (the 8 impose to win money when there is some to be won, but on the other hand to give a share of it away where it is welcome). The naive or soft people and the go-getters without scruples or generosity are the two types of person at risk during this Pinnacle. Ultimately, 8 is the vibration of apprenticeship as well as mastery and acquisition. For the more advanced this period could see the development of these great mental and physical qualities in the favorite area of the individual, for example sport at a high level.
		- You are in a number 8 Pinnacle. You will be confronted by the values of success, competition, money, power and organization early on. You could have to learn little by little to defend the space that you need for your own growth from dominating adults. You could also be confronted with more intensity with money than others (you will have a lot of it, so must learn to manage it with wisdom or a lack of it, so must learn to earn more) or greater professional responsibility, things that are not always easy for an adolescent. But the number 8 vibration is full of energy and it will probably help you not to stay on the edge or on the defensive. You will quickly show your capacity of achievement, combativeness and perhaps your mastery of yourself. This will contribute to your rapid maturity, but also to your harshness sometimes.
		- Advice for parents : Allow the adolescent to develop through action and personal work. Teach [him,her] how to manage money. Initiate [him,her] into the professional and financial world so as to take calculated risk, because it is common with this vibration (especially if it is present elsewhere) that the person knows what [he,she] wants and has the desire to take risks, to surpass [him,herself]. The 8 can appear tough as long as one is not comfortable (in control) with all of this energy and combativeness. Difficulties can follow with emotional or relationships. Conciliation is recommended.

		- You are in a number 8 Pinnacle. This period can be completely satisfying and respond to all your ambitions of richness and social success. A certain aggressiveness of spirit, recklessness and a will to achieve will mark these years. But you don't only invest yourself materially. On the mental side, this period of management and decision taking will be intense. However, nothing will be given for free. It will be necessary to be vigilant, energetic, quick and solid if you want to succeed (ultimately this cycle is the apprenticeship of the master). But don't forget the possible bad points with this vibration. Those that have a too materialistic or cold approach can turn things upside down on account of using this great energy badly. Keep all your flexibility and find the middle path in all of your activities. Make sure you keep a healthy relationship (stature but with mutual respect and a certain generosity) with your collaborators to avoid any unpleasant surprises.

		- You are in a number 8 Pinnacle. Your energy gives you the desire to continue with your activities and to make the most of your position to manage your fortune better or succeed with new challenges. You are not only involved in the material side of things. This period of management and decision taking will be just as intense on the mental side. If this Pinnacle doesn't look good, you must wait for material or financial disappointments and even health problems owing to overwork. This especially if you have a lot of 8's or are in Life Cycle number 8 and then you don't always realize that the lesson of this number 8 is balance, mastery but not sustained pressure or the desire to succeed at any cost.
		- #9/1
		  Pinnacles with the value of 9
		- These phases of activity correspond to accomplishments having one or several of the following characteristics : idealistic or humanitarian connotation, the idea of succeeding, outcome, the idea of universality, sophistication, cultural interest, openings on the world or the future. It is a favorable phase to personal initiatives or blossoming of talents. For example, research, humanitarian missions, artistic achievements at a high level (music, film, dress-making, cooking,....), teaching, achievements linked to foreign lands and innovation. Whatever your personal level, cultural sensitivity and ideals will be very present during your achievements. However, your emotional side will come to know some disturbances (frequent disappointments) during these Pinnacles.
		- You are in a number 9 Pinnacle. To start a period of your life (Cycle or Pinnacle) with a number 9 as your vibration is delicate and not always easy for a child. There is the likelihood of emotional outbursts. The best means to stay balanced consists in following the vibration 9's voice of finality, which is the opening towards others or the outside world, availability, tolerance and altruism. The theory supports the idea that a person who starts life in a number 9 cycle (Pinnacle or Life Cycle) will be someone who had not wanted or had the possibility to achieve the previous life's mission (what would be the interest of life, evolution and good, without the possibility of a continuation ?). In this case, the new life is started with a relatively early maturity and the responsibility of having to finish something or experiment with something before moving on to the new. We understand better from then on the possible inner difficulties that the person will have brought to life as long as [he,she] has the feeling of unachievement. Emotional highs and lows, feelings of incomprehension, problems with communication, sensitivity and phases of depression can all be part of this start of life in spite of undeniable qualities and talents. It is sometimes necessary during this cycle to know how to modify the person's course and not to insist on the projects that pose problems. After this period, the individual will feel distinctly better and will find better [his/her] identity.

		- Love
		- You will develop some tensions. Conflicts will be possible. Avoid them, because you could quickly boil over.

		  Work
		- A rather difficult month of clashes and opposition. You will be ready to defend yourself in order to keep your independence.

The vibrations will be favourable with the result that practically everything you touch will be positive. Even time will work in your favour, so don't get carried away, be patient.

Look at the problems, this will help you to act with lucidity. The afternoon will be different and very favourable for friendships, approach, thought processes and diplomacy. If your mind is at rest after having taken the appropriate decisions this morning, you will have a successful afternoon. During the evening your interest will go in the direction of the good moments of life and even adventure.
		- #2/9
		  A difficult day where the general atmosphere will be inert. You could also suffer a lack of consideration for you from others. However, you must keep confidence in yourself and not doubt just because others lack enthusiasm. It will be up to you alone to judge if your ideas as well founded. Don't allow yourself to be influenced or discouraged. Avoid implicating yourself emotionally and keep a certain reserve. If you know how to keep your good mood and your smile faced with unfavourable circumstances or unexpected obligations it can only reinforce your image.
		- #3/1
		  A lot of creativity an ingenuity on your part but not many positive reactions (or rather slow) from others. Above all don't let yourself be demoralised or irritated. Don't try to force things. Concentrate on your source of creativity and others will end up listening to you and following. A harmonious and pleasant evening.
		- #3/2
		  An excellent day in view. You will be in a good mood, have original ideas and easily make others understand you. Even initiatives which are a bit extravagant will be accepted. Don't hesitate to make the most of such an advantage. New friendships will be possible. Only the evening will be a tone lower.
		- #3/3
		  The morning will have a positive atmosphere. Certainly a lot of inspiration, ideas, a new strategy and initiatives. However, the afternoon will have quite a heavy atmosphere for your love life. Watch out for melancholy or images that you could get in your head ! This is absolutely useless. The evening will be positive for new things and you will probably forget the previous bad moments. Possible evening out and good mood, but don't overdo it !
		- #3/4
		  A morning placed in a climate of annoyance, dissatisfaction and even discouragement. Be prudent, avoid trips or actions presenting risks. From lunchtime, positive vibrations will make the rest of the day more attractive. Don't waste them by lingering on the mornings problems. You will notice sympathy and attention come in your direction. Make the most of these good aspects and this quite unusual recognition to gain an advantage, to appeal for support and to give your projects and image value.
		- #3/5
		  Your imagination and your sense of communication will be very witty today. This will help you to persuade others. You will be brilliant in this area. You will feel that it is easier to bring others round to your point of view, to attract them, rather than demanding or trying to force their choices, seduced by the enthusiasm and the confidence that you put in your suggestions. There is a possible invitation for the evening, but don't get too carried away, contacts will stay superficial.
		- #3/6
		  A climate of dispersion, superficiality and instability will mark this day. You will be carried along by superficial situations or relationships (society small talk) with their hypocrisy, bad advice, etc. Nothing concrete or lasting will come from this day if you don't take preventative measures. Make sure you are organised and respect a strict timetable (not to loose time), and the evening will be a little better. The only positive vibration here concerns your creativity, so don't waste it by scattering yourself.
		- #3/7
		  The afternoon will be a little vague and delicate when it comes to making advancements but the overall the day will be positive. Cheerfulness and vivacity will accompany you from the moment you wake up. At the end of the afternoon you will have quite an exceptional energy and imagination which will make you radiate and show your talent. Try to manage your time well to take advantage of this vibration that will be repeated during this month.
		- #3/8
		  Do you know how to make the most of these exceptional vibrations for conquering and succeeding ? Know that you will be lucky today. Put your conviction in all your undertakings and you won't be disappointed. Financial and relational perspectives are also good today. The day will end with a very favourable evening for invitations, enriching discussions, reflection and friendship.
		- #3/9
		  The vibrations of the start of the morning will give a confused and vague atmosphere. Don't try to unravel it for the moment. Stay calm, don't disperse yourself uselessly, do just what is necessary. The turbulence will cease towards midday. This will allow you to face the numerous obligations that wait for you this afternoon. Even if everything is difficult, stay calm and show a sense of conciliation or goodwill, because it will help you to adapt and finally overcome all the problems.
		- #4/1
		  Very strong vibrations will push you towards perfectionism and the desire to multiply your contacts in order to improve your image. These two strategies cannot always be reconciled, that is why you will have a lot to do today. In order to finish the day well, opt for a relaxing evening where you can let go of your professional responsibilities.
		- #4/2
		  A pleasant day, rich in nice surprises. You will approach your activities in a conscientious way. You will have lucky initiative or a new manner of organising yourself. This will be a constructive cycle. During the afternoon you will have to face unexpected events which will be positive if you know how to approach them correctly. Unplanned things or new obligations will be a part of the end of the day and it is worth taking them with a smile and willingness.
		- #4/3
		  Without a doubt this day is difficult. The vibrations will be contrary and will limit you in your approaches and initiatives. With such a climate, it would be better to take a back seat and abstain from doing too much. Content yourself with simple things. You will be tempted by promising appearances but be aware that the vibration of this day interferes with success. Choose leisure activities, simple happiness and forget these troubles.
		- #4/4
		  A very delicate day. The vibrations are such that all will stagnate, events as well as undertakings. Nothing will succeed. With such an atmosphere it would be better to think twice before getting involved in something important, because you will lack the means and you won't be able to keep your engagements. The evening will have a monotonous and studious atmosphere, so it would be wise to devote yourself calmly to putting things in order and to your obligations (of all types).
		- #4/5
		  You will be animated with a great determination and you will want to show off your moral qualities and your know-how. Only two time periods will make this day difficult : Towards midday and the end of the afternoon. You will be lead to change your plans then, so it would be a good idea to do the important things in the morning. Despite your determination, circumstances are not good for long term investments today. The day will end up well with a more pleasant atmosphere.
		- #4/6
		  A day placed under the sign of energy and independence. These vibrations will raise your assurance and that will positively influence those around you. You will radiate and take things in hand. Your practical sense will be present all day and if you don't neglect any details success can be expected. Some frictions are possible in the afternoon, but don't care. Concentrate on moving forward. After a powerful and active day, you will naturally want an affective evening. It's up to you to get together with those you love. The passing from one cycle to another could perhaps be accompanied by a falling of tension and a brusque (but momentary) rise in your emotions.
		- #4/7
		  The vibration of this day will incite you to take every detail into consideration. You will quickly realise that forgetfulness and negligence will bring problems. You will understand that even the obvious things don't resolve themselves. It is necessary to be orderly and conscientious. The morning will be negative for all attempts at co-operation with others. Expect nothing from others this morning, you will only be disappointed. Fortunately, the afternoon is placed in a more constructive cycle. This will be a good time for making undertakings with respect to your future. During the evening the cycle will be negative for relationships and material things. All that you undertake has a strong risk of going badly. It would be better to stay in retreat this evening.
		- #4/8
		  The vibrations today will be favourable for organisation, order and basic work. Concentrate on simple tasks all day and watch out that you don't divert because an additional vibration will make you emotionally unstable. If you don't take care, you could let yourself to be constantly carried along to change your opinion or your place. This affective instability could also lead you to be admiring or to criticise too easily. Deception is assured, so watch out ! In the evening, the cycle will be favourable to your well-being, spiritually and physically. Relax, do some sport or meditate.
		- #4/9
		  From the morning, you will enter into a cycle where your sensitivity will be aggravated. This can be positive or negative according to your character. You could be tempted to let yourself go, to ignore your obligations and get sucked into a spiral of mood swings. If you are very creative, this state could help you a lot. Although the best way to succeed with this day is to make concessions, efforts and put yourself forward. Don't give up your mood changes. Stay positive and straightforward. Don't be stopped by the first snag or misunderstanding. Avoid investing money or spending today because you are too emotional.
		- #5/1
		  A double tinted day because you will constantly hesitate between prudence and the desire to rush ahead, to innovate or to go towards the unknown. It seems wiser to be prudent during the morning and to avoid uncertainties. On the other hand, the afternoon with be favourable for audacity. Good ideas will come by themselves and the new and unusual will attract you. Be daring ! You will be enthusiastic until late in the evening, you will want to meet people and move. Your sensuality will also be awake. Use this favourable cycle if you want but always keep your good sense !
		- #5/2
		  The vibrations of this day will favour a certain emotional fragility and even a tendency for illusions. Take precautions. Not all meetings will be advantageous. Watch out for obstacles. They can teach you something but also create an inner storm according to your attitude towards them. This aspect will stop around midday to leave the place for a very positive cycle with respect to your activities. You will be very creative. Friends will give you good advice. You will have good opportunities. Your vivacious mind will be a supplementary asset for achievements and the day will definitely be fruitful (and favourable for communication).
		- #5/3
		  Considering the vibrations of this day, the best strategy would be to take on several different activities. The good atmosphere will stimulate you and if you like activity, vivacity or combativeness, you will get it. Success will be on your side in the morning but towards midday it will be necessary to struggle. The end of the day will be marked by a new vibration inciting a philosophical and dispassionate view of things in opposition to this dynamic and certainly enriching cycle that you have lived this morning. You will want to centre yourself and reflect more. Do it !
		- #5/4
		  A day marked by the call for freedom. You will feel carefree, audacious, as if you were protected. You will want to live to 100% (prudence all the same). Your aspirations will be for wide open spaces, travelling, freedom and new things. Etiquette and social pressure won't concern you as much. The morning will be favourable for business and travelling, but in the afternoon it would be better to refrain a little from this hunger for freedom, because obligations (affective or family it seems) will progressively surge as you near the end of the evening. This day could prove interesting for your future if you don't hesitate to go in front of others.
		- #5/5
		  The atmosphere of this day is new. It will be rich in changes and surprises. Your particularly lively mind today will allow you to adapt quickly to all situations. You will find solutions to problems that have been hanging around for several days. All will evolve very quickly in the morning. If you have steps to take, approach or interview to do, take them because everything is still very beneficial. In the afternoon, everything will not always end up positive and you will find it difficult to concentrate and stabilise yourself. This agitation will stop around 6 PM and a positive, dynamic cycle will take it's place, so take advantage of it. You will be brimming with vitality, be enthusiastic, have influence over others as well as charm. So you will have a passionate evening. The ideal would be to break up this day with a bit of sport in order to prepare yourself for the evening.
		- #5/6
		  After the very good vibrations of this morning will come a contrary afternoon. This morning will be one of the best for tying contracts, convincing, conquering, seducing and engaging your future (especially professional). In the afternoon you risk seeing the change of vibration meeting quite a few annoyances and hitches as far as relationships and request are concerned. Certain stifling situations will become more acute and you won't be able to disentangle yourself from them yet. From midday to 6 PM it would be better to occupy yourself with minor tasks. Be careful if you opt for other activities. The calmer evening will allow you to prepare to resolve current problems and coming obligations.
		- #5/7
		  An extremely favourable atmosphere will mark your day. You will have an enthusiasm and success such that nobody and nothing will seem able to resist you. All of your actions will be fruitful. Things will roll with a disconcerting ease. All areas will be impregnated with this magic, particularly friendship and sentimental. New contacts will be favoured, you will have the desire to please and to charm, particularly during the second part of the day.
		- #5/8
		  The morning risks not going as smoothly as you expected. Don't be disappointed because everything will turn out right in the afternoon, with some unexpected things (with the condition that you have a supple mind to accept certain concessions). The notions of freedom and great possibilities will impregnate your mind. Make the most of this positive cycle for communication, undertakings, negotiating and requests for support. You will approach the evening with a desire for luxury, well-being. Probably a good atmosphere and the possibility of meeting new people (if evening out).
		- #5/9
		  Today you will benefit from a new enthusiasm which will enlarge your world if you know how to make the most of it. As soon as you feel this current, seize the occasion to move things forward, take decisions, assert yourself and flaunt your serenity (especially in the afternoon). This will be a period where despite everything, you will have to prove your ability, ingenuity and perseverance. The circumstances will be quite demanding but can drive you towards a beneficial renewal and a positive evolution. To approach the evening in the best possible way and avoid probable relationship tensions or possible strong decompressions after this arduous day, take the time to do a little sport in order to liberate the accumulated tension. In this way you will have a relaxed evening.
		- #6/1
		  The day will start with an atmosphere of limitations. Some big obstacles will get in your way and rather than tiring yourself out by trying to overcome them, it would be better to show patience and prudence. From midday you will penetrate a new cycle where all will go well until about 6 PM. Why not profit by moving things forward and gaining an advantage over your interlocutors which is possible thanks to your serenity and assurance. In the evening, you can relax and make the most of this very favourable cycle with regards to the affective area.
		- #6/2
		  A very dynamic day opens itself to you. You will be very awakened and the morning will be rather good for your projects. Unfortunately, this energy risks being transformed to tension and agitation in the afternoon. If you don't take precautions, you will find it difficult to organise yourself or to work correctly especially with the responsibilities and obligations (more than usual). The evening will be orientated to affection, love and the family. A really nice cycle from which you will continue to feel the effects over the next few days.
		- #6/3
		  A delicate day ! You will feel in demand, your sensitivity and willingness will be played on, used by others. Think twice before making promises or taking on new responsibilities because it is certain that you will accept them too easily. Also the vibrations of this day are not favourable for getting mixed up in the peoples affairs, so be careful ! It would be better not to accept or ask for thinking time so that you can see things more clearly. In fact, this is not a good day for important business, especially in the afternoon when you will lack lucidity. The evening will start with the impression of overwork, so the best thing would be to relax, to think about yourself before going to bed (quite early).
		- #6/4
		  The vibrations of this day will make you amorous, or in all cases sensitive to affection and charm. The working world and it's materialistic constraints will seem anachronistic to you even if you don't lose your good sense. Strangely you will want to express your feelings but you won't find it easy to do so. You will have difficulties to communicate and to share your sentimental desires, especially in the afternoon when you mustn't make commitments, talk too much or try to force things. Otherwise, errors are a strong possibility in work as well as heart matters. Act in the morning or the evening but don't push things in case of difficulties. If there are no snags of this type, this day will be one of happiness and you will feel the effects for several days.
		- #6/5
		  This morning, you could benefit in a providential way for your heart matters. Communication and loving sharing will be perfect. This is the moment to gain advantages, to act intelligently and sincerely before these favourable vibrations soften and the situation becomes confused. The afternoon will be less idyllic for the affective and it would be a good idea not to talk too much. Be content with a minimum and some smiles because slips are possible. On the other hand the cycle is very favourable to the professional side of things. Your ideas will be clearer. In consequence, use the afternoon to organise and realise your thoughts, initiatives, analyses, investments or profits.
		- #6/6
		  The morning will be favourable to friendship, discussion, company and artistic activities. People will be attracted by you. This period can be fruitful and will help you in an interesting way with your activities. The atmosphere changes in the afternoon and will stimulate you more to regulate administrative tasks with efficiency, even if this doesn't really enchant you. On your way you risk approaching the evening badly and you will be a bit intolerant or demanding with those around you. You won't accept certain attitudes from your partner very well for example. Possible conflict. Also be careful of the unexpected and your lack of ability to adapt.
		- #6/7
		  It is advised to make the most of this very favourable morning for your professional activities. Everything will smile at you. If you need support to achieve your projects, don't hesitate to ask the influent people. Their reaction will certainly be positive. The afternoon and evening vibrations will influence your mood a little. You will be less concentrated on work and more interested in the affective. If you already have someone, you will have moments of happiness. Otherwise it is in your interest to accept invitations or evening out.
		- #6/8
		  A difficult day which can finish in a convivial atmosphere if you arrange things well. Today, you will probably meet numerous obstacles and difficulties of communication. Be patient and diplomatic. Establish a good dialogue allowing everyone to express their desires in order to avoid tensions and misunderstandings. You may have new responsibilities or obligations to assume. Above all don't let yourself get upset. Act with determination and efficiency. If all goes well, you will approach the evening with serenity and you can dedicate yourself to close ones or friends in a good and authentic atmosphere.
		- #6/9
		  An exhausting morning, followed by a pleasant and harmonious afternoon. The first part of the day will be very charged. You will be very much in demand. Responsibilities, stress and dispersion. Also people will no longer have respect or consideration for you and you will feel a little ill-treated or exploited. Watch out for stress and appearances in the morning. Hold yourself back a little and observe. In the afternoon this agitated atmosphere will stop to make way for something more pleasant and enriching. Your affairs and your initiatives will be favoured, your relationships will be friendly and you will at last have time for yourself. If you have any relationship problems to sort out make the most of this cycle because it is favourable for reconciliation's.
		- #7/1
		  A charged day where you will be worried about financial or administrative problems. The cycle will be unfavourable to speculation and new affairs, especially in the morning. Administrative tasks will mobilise you for a good part of the day. It is only during the evening, after having sorted things out, that you will feel better, with perhaps a regained energy to continue with... planning and organising !
		- #7/2
		  An ideal day for introspection, reflection, intuition and research. If your activities concern the intellectual, scientific or spiritual areas, you will be fulfilled. Your inspiration will be quite powerful and enable you to discover inner treasures or answers to questions. Allow yourself to observe, meditate or analyse. You will obtain results. All other tasks (material, affective, commercial or financial) will be in a really negative cycle. Be prudent, and if possible abstain from getting involved in these areas.
		- #7/3
		  A day rich in the unexpected. You must improvise and not make too rigid plans so that you can make the changes that will be necessary. Stay serene, don't try to refuse this evolution of things or you could run into problems. Use it to your advantage. The afternoon risks being quite hard concerning the material or financial. Stay impassive and don't become discouraged. Obviously it would be better to avoid investing money or buying, in these conditions because you would regret it ! If you make the right manoeuvres and stay calm, you will be rewarded with a pleasant evening made for company and tenderness.
		- #7/4
		  The vibrations of this day favour the search for truth and indirectly happiness. You will be attracted by reflection, analysis and listening. The morning will be rather favourable for sharing ideas, discussions and intense relationships. The afternoon and the evening need rather isolation and tranquillity. Everything that is superficial or noisy will make you run away. Finally, the day will be a success and very beneficial for your inner balance if you know how to stay away from everyday agitation and it's possible annoyances.
		- #7/5
		  The day is going to start well ! Your magnetism will wake up and allow you to profit in the relational and creative areas to gain advantages. The afternoon will be a little strained and your routine disturbed. All will calm down at about 6 PM and the evening will be peaceful but instructive, with discussions and exchanging ideas which will enlighten you, perhaps so as to renew your image and strategy for the future.
		- #7/6
		  The vibrations of this day will make you a bit bizarre and possibly irritated. A certain impatience or animosity will mark your actions and gestures. Perhaps this will be related to the difficulties that you are going to meet to find respect in your professional activities or in succeeding with your tasks. Today, it would be better to avoid delicate tasks. relationship conflicts, risks of all sorts (for example investing money, buying or selling). Try to do things on a small scale or even better abstain. If you succeed staying in the background, being calm and getting on with your work, you will have a peaceful evening where you can find harmony again. If not, it is probable that the day's incidents will multiply. It would be a good idea to do something that makes you feel good in the morning (sport, intellectual, manual).
		- #7/7
		  Intuition and analysis will be honoured today. If you pose questions about life, your strategy, you will certainly find answers. Your clairvoyance and capable mind will perform and help you to construct good things. This day will be very favourable to your growth. If intuition and inspiration are already some of your qualities, this will be a marvellous day for you. However, you must avoid getting too involved in outside actions or activities. Let things come to you rather that you going to them. Also watch out for financial transactions, they are not in a good cycle.
		- #7/8
		  A delicate day where action is not recommended. Don't try to provoke events. Let things come to you. If you know how to be patient and confident, you will be surprised with the benefits that Providence will give you. If you force things on the other hand or hod resentment, it is probable that things will go badly. If you cannot reduce your activities, try at least to keep your distance and survey your path. The evening will be favourable for discussions and the resolution of problems (other peoples) thanks to your knowledge.
		- #7/9
		  Certain vibrations will make you melancholy this morning. You will be a bit psychologically saturated. Everything will slow down. Your vision of things will be negative. Rather than sinking in this pessimism, keep serene and be delighted because the afternoon will bring a new glow which will erase the memory of the morning. You will want open space, freedom, adventure, sensations and even affection. If you know how to moderate your sudden passion a little, this period will go well and keep it's positive dynamism. Your receptivity, creativity and sense of contact will be on the front line. This will perhaps drive you towards enriching meetings or interesting realisations. Don't try to force things because the atmosphere isn't ready.
		- #8/1
		  A hyper active day opens itself to you. From the morning you will be motivated by efficiency. You will want to sort out your affairs. Your motto will be something like 'straight to the goal with no side tracks", which promises discussions or initiatives a bit peremptory. In the afternoon, this energy will soften and all will appear vague, unstable and uncertain. You must be prudent and keep your distance in order to see more clearly. It would be better to organise yourself so as not to have any important decisions to make this afternoon. Avoid engagement, especially financial, until the evening when the cycle will become positive again for business.
		- #8/2
		  A delicate and tiring day. You program strongly risks becoming disturbed by some unexpected events. You will find yourself in strained situations with uncooperative people. It would be better to avoid taking risks, moving around, travelling or asking for support this afternoon. Concentrate only on your work, orderliness, the office, organisation or reflection in order to resolve current problems. It is useless to throw yourself into new projects for the moment. If you get over the hurdles, you will have a rather pleasant evening in excellent company.
		- #8/3
		  If you are working to build a big project, the vibrations of this morning will give you an important and perhaps decisive momentum. Try to make the most of it to raise the number of your supports and reinforce yourself. The afternoon will be less easy and you could come across restricting or embarrassing aspects. Appearances will be quite deceptive so it would be a good idea not to engage in new things, sign contracts or take risks. Show a minimum of prudence in only occupying yourself with what you already know. In this way all will go well !
		- #8/4
		  An excellent day for those whose activities concern artistic or creative sectors. A day which favours harmony, success and recognition. Your assets will be a very fertile imagination (morning and evening) as well as an undeniable brilliance which brings you influence over others. If you know how to keep your tact and flexibility you will certainly convince all the people around you. However, use these abilities of communication honestly and avoid becoming too harsh or intolerant because the charm would vanish. To make the most of these good aspects avoid dispersion and going too slowly (daydreaming, stroll). Concentrate on one important activity with flexibility and determination, and you will be surprised with the positive results. Only the afternoon will be a little delicate due to the rapidity of events.
		- #8/5
		  With such vibrations it would be a good idea to be on guard. Appearances will be deceptive. Don't put people on a pedestal this morning. The afternoon cycle will be happier. You will benefit from favourable conditions to improve your affairs and finances. This positive cycle will continue into the evening with regard to the affective and relational aspects. A good end to the day !
		- #8/6
		  A very favourable morning for investments or buying. If you have such intentions, they will work out well. In the afternoon things will be rather bad. The atmosphere will be unstable. Avoid haste completely. Don't get involved in other people's affairs, occupy yourself with your own quality of life. The evening atmosphere risks getting heavier and tensions are possible. Opt for escape, sport, the open air, and let the storm pass.
		- #8/7
		  This morning you will have extraordinary punch. You won't have any time to lose and you will be tempted to take unusual or daring initiatives. Master of yourself, you will have the tendency to denounce injustices and speak your mind. It is a good time to undertake tasks, invest or make decisions. From midday it would be wise not to take important decisions. Better concentrate on your defence. In effect, you risk meeting frustrations, annoyances that you will only overcome after numerous efforts at the end of the afternoon. The evening will be positive again.
		- #8/8
		  Conditions today will be particularly hard and demanding. Nonchalance, passivity, a lowering of vigilance and a lack of consistence will quickly be sanctioned. You must be on the look out to show your precision as well as your courage, combativeness and intelligence. The results of this day will equal your efforts, your desire to master events and your capacity not to lose sight of things which are important to you. The morning will be a source of hitches and having to start again while the afternoon, more favourable, will help you move your affairs forward. In the evening, the atmosphere will be a little electric.
		- #8/9
		  A black day in view. The atmosphere will be electric and strained. Avoid implicating yourself, whether in discussion, interview or tasks. Watch out for conflicting interests or points of view. Be diplomatic, polite and if you can, stay away from annoyances by concentrating on an activity which brings you something, orderliness or sport for example. When the evening arrives, you will then have a good mental disposition to make the most of this beneficial cycle for studying, reflection, art, reading or the spiritual.
		- #9/1
		  This is the day of "cleaning". You will be pushed to clean up your situation, particularly where relationships are concerned (private or professional). You can make the most of these vibrations to modify a forced relationship which you have been unhappy with for some time. If you know how to be flexible and available, unexpected solutions will come, to your great relief. You could also meet new people and have success. Stranger are often friends that we don't know yet ! This energy will continue until the evening when you will be motivated by arranging things and tidying up lose ends.
		- #9/2
		  A delicate day with regard to the material and affective. Tensions and conflicts are feared in the morning. Negotiations, conversations or requests for support will not be welcome during this period. Although this cycle persists after lunch, a new vibration will be added to it favouring creators, inventors and artists. This powerful inspiration will be maintained until the end of the evening and you will be pushed to run away from noise and the agitation of the world in order to find yourself again, re-center yourself, create and understand.
		- #9/3
		  The day won't start very well for all that is material. It would be better not to invest money (or take important decision). This day will be equally difficult in the affective area. Tensions, conflict, clarification and rupture are possible. But be reassured that it will end up positively, especially in the evening thanks to the intervention of a kind and diplomatic person who will contribute to a reconciliation or clear up the misunderstanding. Seize this helping hand ! Furthermore, creativity and sensitivity will be good today.
		- #9/4
		  This is the ideal day to conclude family or administrative affairs. If you can release yourself from burdensome obligations, you will have a mind free for thinking about new projects which will certainly succeed in the future. In the evening, you will want to escape, to change horizons and share your enthusiasm with those you love. This day will be positive for material affairs as long as you don't buy or invest !
		- #9/5
		  The vibrations of this morning cycle favour all that concerns business, travelling and visiting with a view to tie up current affairs. Make the most of your dynamism during the morning. Take advantage of your vivacious mind, your ability for communication in the afternoon. In effect, this period won't be very favourable to travelling but will suit meetings better (discussions and requests for support). You will be convincing during this period and you will get very satisfying results. Organise yourself with a view to this. Financial transactions and speculations should be avoided today.
		- #9/6
		  The atmosphere of this day will be rather bad. Neither the spiritual or the material will be good until about 6 PM. It would be desirable to take a back seat as much as possible, to avoid getting involved and giving your opinion. Don't take any risks, avoid having to make important decisions. If you avoid the traps and preserved your credibility, you will approach the evening in very good conditions and you will know the joys of friendship and authenticity.
		- #9/7
		  You are going to be in a very delicate cycle today. The ground will be undermined, propositions doubtful and promises not kept. Affective engagements in particular but also other things, will only lead to insatisfaction. You also risk meeting coldness and even a harmful will. Keep yourself away from all that and concentrate on activities of reflection, meditation or reading. Otherwise try to be more subtle than these obstacles. The evening will bring less unpleasant vibrations but the affective area will remain a little fragile.
		- #9/8
		  A relatively testing day, sprinkled with struggles and efforts. Fortunately providential support will help you to finally resolve this confusion. So you will approach the evening in a very good state of mind. Brilliant and satisfied, you will feel particularly good about yourself. The evening will be rich with friendships, people will be unconsciously attracted by your well-being, which will give you great pleasure.
		- #9/9

- ## Transit Magi
  collapsed:: true
	- Numerology
	  & The Transit Magi
	- The Transits Magi allow one to obtain an interesting and revelatory lighting on a year from birthday to birthday. This system of complex calculation comes from the Chaldean civilization (3000 years before Christ).
	- It constitutes complementary information of the base element which is your Personal Year Number.
	- Here is how to interpret your Transit:
	- #13
	  Transit 13. Mixed. Favorable period to a major or profound transformation. Followed by a rebirth in your activities or spiritual life.
	- #14
	  Transit 14. A positive period as long as you show your patience and ability to be harmonious. Be ready to come to an arrangement if necessary. Be flexible.
	- #15
	  Transit 15. A mixed period that can lead to material satisfactions but that requires also a great prudence. There will be some temptations especially on the sexual field.
	- #16
	  Transit 16. Negative. A major problem can happen. Be particularly cautious, avoid arrogance. Can be in relation with a failure, an accident or a loss. Don't take risks.
	- #17
	  Transit 17. Positive. A period of protection. Follow your lucky star !
	- #18
	  Transit 18. Negative. Period of vagueness. Possible traps, disappointments, lies, errors. Be careful about appearances !
	- #19
	  Transit 19. Positive. Period of success for the individual action, innovation and work. Good vibrations in the affective and relational areas (love, serenity, success and recognition). This transit is in relation with the 19th Tarot card which symbolizes the sun. You will inherit the energy and strength of radiation for your undertakings and your growth, or for better discovering your strategic errors and to start again along a healthier path. With the 19 in transit, you must preserve and use all these potentials because it is a rather lucky period. However, be careful all those who have things too easy, that the success doesn't dazzle your good sense (pride possible) and lead you to refuse communication.
	- #20
	  Transit 20. Positive. An excellent period for renewal, beneficial changes, meeting new people, even the possibility of a union. It is a favorable phase to change state, improve your material or social position (new contracts or projects), free yourself from hindrances or obstacles. This transit is in relation with the 20th Tarot card symbolizing Judgment, the passage from one state to another, the liberation of certain ties. With 20 in transit, you can expect a nice surprise. Landmarks are going to change and thus will bring you a more comfortable approach to problems and their solutions. Hold on to this new star and make the most of it in order to advance. There will be a lot more energy, enthusiasm, imagination and inspiration than usual (but stay lucid). Possible spiritual openings.
	- #21
	  Transit 21. Positive. An excellent period with success in most areas. This vibration is without a doubt the strongest and everything that is started under this vibration is favored. This transit presupposes a good result concerning your past efforts, compensation, the highest point, when it's a matter of a material, intellectual or artistic creation or a new being. This is a vibration of harmony, love, fullness or perfectionism. However, keep a good overall view. Don't scatter yourself and cry out victory too early. It would be better not to cry victory at all but to savor it for yourself.
	- #22
	  Transit 22. Mixed. This phase concerns the material life, construction capacities and above all decisions. You must be prudent faced with your judgment and take advice if necessary. Watch out for heedlessness, imprudence and fantasy which often accompany this vibration. Also a certain inner tension, difficulties to channel your energy. If you avoid these diversions, this will be a good period for you to resolve difficult practical problems, to make projects, to have ambitious objectives and to benefit from inspiration. But most of the decisions will not find their full application until the following year. This transit constitutes in general, a relatively delicate rebalancing phase, so don't be too impulsive. Take a back seat.
	- #23
	  Transit 23. Neutral-positive. Indication of mobility and frequent changes. This transit has a more masculine connotation (and influence) than feminine. Energy, a strength of action and support in your surroundings even a certain protection in your undertakings. Certainly positive new things professionally. In general, the merits will be well recognized by those around you. It is a good year to travel, to have new relationships and to create new contacts.
	- #24
	  Transit 24. Neutral-positive. Favorable period for looking for harmony with those around you. Relationships are in the foreground and generally in a favorable atmosphere. This 24 Transit is directly linked to a feminine influence. The future can depend on female support. A woman will be able to help towards solidity and material success, often through the incitement of taking on new responsibilities. Sometimes you will have to confront unwanted obligations (removal, changing status) and make sacrifices in order to continue advancing along your path.
	- #25
	  Transit 25. Neutral-negative. A slow period, lateness, instability and sometimes uncomfortable changes. Various obstacles, starting again, difficulties to conquer and often little problems. It would be good to reflect on the causes of this professional instability in order to re-establish the balance at the source. Take a back seat. If correction cannot be envisaged for the moment, be patient. Avoid wasting your energy and your spirit, if you act in a clumsy fashion. Above all don't abandon your objectives.
	- #26
	  Transit 26. Mixed. Period linked to money and concrete projects. Rather contrasting, this transit can bring good or bad surprises, especially financial. This could be favorable for business carried out individually because the risk would come from bad associations or a lack of help from those around you at the necessary moment. To be more sure, watch out for the management of your business, don't take useless risks. Better think twice (take a back seat to a certain degree). Adopt rules of " vital minimum security " in order to avoid the temptations on the part of your associates and your own errors of judgment. Good possibilities of expansion if the balance is found. Be very prudent.
	- #27
	  Transit 27. Mixed. Prudence will be required during this very delicate period where betrayals are possible from close ones (strong deception, difficult aspects). A certain detachment (material as well as affective) would be the best preventive method. Sometimes a review will be imposed in the relational area as well as changes. Adopt an intelligent and subtle attitude and don't fall into the trap of this vibration in reacting badly or emotionally. On the other hand, it is highly possible that you will benefit from a certain inspiration and a chance to finish a project and reach success (the foreign or anything that differs from your usual environment will be favorable). This " test " is in a way a phase of initiation which will give you the possibility to gain a greater maturity from the experience. This realization will help you to advance in life thanks to a more stable base.
	- #28
	  Transit 28. Mixed-negative. Period of fluctuation, duality, opposition, competition even inner contradictions which will require a regrouping of your energies and a greater concentration in order to defend your interests. Alliances are favorable and welcome in this active and uncertain phase, with the condition that the limits are well defined and not over-stepped so that you don't lose the respect or confidence from others. If co-operation cannot be envisaged where everyone wins, then get along alone ! It is probable during this cycle that you will frequently waver between the need to co-operate, to be helped and the need to manage your life alone. But once again, well managed associations can bring you a lot during this year.
	- #29
	  Transit 29. Mixed. Apart from some relational or professional disappointments which aren't too serious (and on which you mustn't dwell), you will be successful in showing your capacities (especially creative) and transmitting them or being recognized by others. So it is possibly a prestigious and idealistic phase. You will find it difficult to channel all the energy at your disposition without a doubt. That's why it would be better to act serenely and banish all haste this (it could be source of error for you this year). Open up to your inspiration and intuition. Keep your distance. Don't scatter yourself.
	- Last advice : Pay particular attention to the concrete aspects of things because you are in a phase which is a bit too idealistic and it can lead to some bad surprises if you neglect the fact that others don't necessarily share your impulses.
	- #30
	  Transit 30. Positive. Excellent period for creative activities.
	- #31
	  Transit 31. Positive. Favorable for new project. Financial stability.
	- #32
	  Transit 32. Mixed-positive. It is necessary for you to take your decisions with caution.
	- #33
	  Transit 33. Positive. Excellent period for the family or for helping others.
