# Intro


## TYPES

### Methylcobalamin

Methylcobalamin is the most bio-available type of Vitamin B12 which means the body absorbs it more easily. Naturally occurring, it is found in animal-based foods such as meat, fish, milk and eggs so Methylcobalamin B12 is readily available in many people’s daily diets.

It is the most active form of Vitamin B12 and is used mainly in the liver, brain and nervous system.

### Adenosylcobalamin

Adenosylcobalamin is also a naturally occurring, co-enzyme form of Vitamin B12. Consider it a ‘partner in crime’ with Methylcobalamin, as they work in synergy to give pretty much 100% ‘B12 cover’ for your body.

Adenosylcobalamin is particularly important to supporting and protecting the mitochondria in your cells (which the Methylcobalamin can’t do). The mitochondria are like ‘powerhouses’ in each cell and Adenosylcobalamin helps them burn food efficiently to produce energy and boost metabolism.

Additionally, Adenosylcobalamin is a key component of the myelin sheath which protects the nerve cells in the body and brain and enables them to respond very quickly to stimuli.

### Hydroxocobalamin

Hydroxocobalamin is naturally produced by bacteria in the digestive tract when food sources are broken down. It can also be developed in a laboratory by extracting it from microorganisms.

In supplement form, it’s only available on prescription and is usually given by injection under the medical supervision of a GP.  This form of Vitamin B12 is readily converted by the body into Adenosylcobalamin and Methylcobalamin ready for the cells to absorb and use it.

### Cyanocobalamin

Cyanocobalamin is an artificial form of Vitamin B12 which the body converts into the active forms of Methylcobalamin and Adenosylcobalamin, ready for use.

Cobalt and cyanide are fermented to make cyanocobalamin. That’s correct. Cyanide. It is in miniscule amounts, but it is still cyanide.

Being man-made, this form of Vitamin B12 isn’t found naturally in food sources: you’ll only find it in supplements. It is the cheapest form of Vitamin B12.

Cyanocobalamin is, as its name suggests, a bond between vitamin B12 and a cyano group. These are split in the body and the reaction partly produces cyanide, a substance commonly known as a neurotoxin.
